\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}

The interest in the freely available statistical programming language
and software environment \texttt{R} \citep{R-base} is soaring. By the
time we wrote first drafts for this project, more than 11000 addons
(many of them providing cutting-edge methods) were made available on the
Comprehensive \texttt{R} Archive Network
(\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN}), an extensive network of FTP
servers around the world that store identical and up-to-date versions of
\texttt{R} code and its documentation. \texttt{R} dominates other
(commercial) software for statistical computing in most fields of
research in applied statistics. The benefits of it being freely
available, open source and having a large and constantly growing
community of users that contribute to CRAN render \texttt{R} more and
more appealing for empirical economists and econometricians as well.

A striking advantage of using \texttt{R} in econometrics courses is that
it enables students to explicitly document their analysis step-by-step
such that it is easy to update and to expand. This allows to re-use code
for similar applications with different data. Furthermore, \texttt{R}
programs are fully reproducible which makes it straightforward for
others to comprehend and validate results.

Over the recent years, \texttt{R} has thus become an integral part of
the curricula of econometrics classes we teach at University of
Duisburg-Essen. In some sense, learning to code is comparable to
learning a foreign language and continuous practice is essential for the
learning success. Of course, presenting bare \texttt{R} code chunks on
slides has mostly a deterring effect for the students to engage with
programming on their own. This is why we offer tutorials where both
econometric theory and its applications using \texttt{R} are introduced,
for some time now. As for accompanying literature, there are some
excellent books that deal with \texttt{R} and its applications to
econometrics like \citet{kleiber2008}. However, we have found that these
works are somewhat difficult to access, especially for undergraduate
students in economics having little understanding of econometric methods
and predominantly no experience in programming at all. Consequently, we
have started to compile a collection of reproducible reports for use in
class. These reports provide guidance on how to implement selected
applications from the textbook \emph{Introduction to Econometrics}
\citep{stock2015} which serves as a basis for the lecture and the
accompanying tutorials. The process is facilitated considerably by
\texttt{knitr} \citep{R-knitr} and \texttt{rmarkdown}
\citep{R-rmarkdown}. In conjunction, both \texttt{R} packages provide
powerful tools for dynamic report generation which allow to seamlessly
combine pure text, LaTeX, \texttt{R} code and its output in a variety of
formats, including PDF and HTML. Being inspired by \emph{Using R for
Introductory Econometrics} \citep{heiss2016}\footnote{\citet{heiss2016}
  builds on the popular \emph{Introductory Econometrics} by
  \citet{wooldridge2016} and demonstrates how to replicate the
  applications discussed therein using \texttt{R}.} and with this
powerful toolkit at hand we decided to write up our own empirical
companion to \citet{stock2015} which resulted in \textbf{U}sing
\textbf{R} \textbf{f}or \textbf{I}ntroduction \textbf{t}o
\textbf{E}conometrics (\emph{URFITE}).

Similarly to the book by \citet{heiss2016} this project is neither a
comprehensive econometrics textbook nor is it intended to be a general
introduction \texttt{R}. \emph{URFITE} is best described as an
interactive script in the style of a reproducible research report which
aims to provide students of economic sciences with a
platform-independent e-learning arrangement by seamlessly intertwining
theoretical core knowledge and empirical skills in undergraduate
econometrics. Of course the focus is set on empirical applications with
\texttt{R}; we leave out tedious derivations and formal proofs wherever
we can. \emph{URFITE} is closely aligned on \citet{stock2015} which does
very well in motivating theory by real-world applications. However, we
take it a step further and enable students not only to learn how results
of case studies can be replicated with \texttt{R} but we also intend to
strengthen their ability in using the newly acquired skills in other
empirical applications --- immediately within \emph{URFITE}.

To realize this, each chapter contains interactive \texttt{R}
programming exercises. These exercises are used as supplements to code
chunks that display how previously discussed techniques can be
implemented within \texttt{R}. They are generated using the
\href{https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light}{DataCamp light widget}
and are backed by an \texttt{R} session which is maintained on
\href{https://www.datacamp.com/home}{DataCamp}'s servers. You may play
around with the example exercise presented below.

\begin{center}\textit{This interactive application is only available in the HTML version.}\end{center}

As you can see above, the widget consists of two tabs. \texttt{script.R}
mimics an \texttt{.R}-file, a file format that is commonly used for
storing \texttt{R} code. Lines starting with a \# are commented out,
that is, they are not recognized as code. Furthermore, \texttt{script.R}
works like an exercise sheet where you may write down the solution you
come up with. If you hit the button \emph{Run}, the code will be
executed, submission correctness tests are run and you will be notified
whether your approach is correct. If it is not correct, you will receive
feedback suggesting improvements or hints. The other tab,
\texttt{R Console}, is a fully functional \texttt{R} console that can be
used for trying out solutions to exercises before submitting them. Of
course you may submit (almost any) \texttt{R} code and use the console
to play around and explore. Simply type a command and hit the enter key
on your keyboard.

As an example, consider the following line of code presented in chunk
below. It tells \texttt{R} to compute the number of packages available
on \texttt{CRAN}. The code chunk is followed by the output produced.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# compute the number of packages available on CRAN}
\KeywordTok{nrow}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{available.packages}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{repos =} \StringTok{"http://cran.us.r-project.org"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 12742
\end{verbatim}

Each code chunk is equipped with a button on the outer right hand side
which copies the code to your clipboard. This makes it convenient to
work with larger code segments. In the widget above, you may click on
\texttt{R Console} and type \texttt{nrow(available.packages())} (the
command from the code chunk above) and execute it by hitting
\emph{Enter} on your keyboard\footnote{The \texttt{R} session is
  initialized by clicking anywhere into the widget. This might take a
  few seconds. Just wait for the indicator next to the button \emph{Run}
  to turn green.}

As you might have noticed, there are some out-commented lines in the
widget that ask you to assign a numeric value to a variable and then to
print the variable's content to the console. You may enter your solution
approach to \texttt{script.R} and hit the button \emph{Run} in order to
get the feedback described further above. In case you do not know how to
solve this sample exercise (don't panic, that is probably why you are
reading this), a click on \emph{Hint} will prompt you with some advice.
If you still can't find a solution, a click on \emph{solution} will
provide you with another tab, \texttt{Solution.R} which contains sample
solution code. It will often be the case that exercises can be solved in
many different ways and \texttt{Solution.R} presents what we consider as
comprehensible and idiomatic.

\item
  Constant width text on gray background is used to indicate \texttt{R}
  code that can be typed literally by you. It may appear in paragraphs
  for better distinguishability among executable and non-executable code
  statements but it will mostly be encountered in shape of large blocks
  of \texttt{R} code. These blocks are referred to as code chunks (see

\section{\texorpdfstring{A Very Short Introduction to \texttt{R} and
\emph{RStudio}}{A Very Short Introduction to  and RStudio}}\label{a-very-short-introduction-to-and-rstudio}

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/rstudio} 

}

\caption{RStudio: the four panes}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-7}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{R}
Basics}{ Basics}}\label{basics}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\texttt{R} Basics}

As mentioned before, this book is not intended to be an introduction to
\texttt{R} but as a guide on how to use its capabilities for
applications commonly encountered in undergraduate econometrics. Those
having basic knowledge in \texttt{R} programming will feel comfortable
starting with Chapter \ref{pt}. This section, however, is meant for
those who have not worked with \texttt{R} or \emph{RStudio} before. If
you at least know how to create objects and call functions, you can skip
it. If you would like to refresh your memories or get a feeling for how
to work with \emph{RStudio}, keep reading.

First of all start \emph{RStudio} and create a new \texttt{R} script by
selecting \emph{File}, \emph{New File}, \emph{R Script}. In the editor
pane, type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and click on the button labeled \emph{Run} in the top right corner of
the editor. By doing so, your line of code is send to the console and
the result of this operation should be displayed right underneath it. As
you can see, \texttt{R} works just like a calculator. You can do all the
arithmetic calculations by using the corresponding operator (\texttt{+},
\texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/} or \texttt{\textasciicircum{}}). If
you are not sure what the last operator does, try it out and check the
results.

\subsubsection*{Vectors}\label{vectors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Vectors}

\texttt{R} is of course more sophisticated than that. We can work with
variables or more generally objects. Objects are defined by using the
assignment operator \texttt{<-}. To create a variable named \texttt{x}
which contains the value \texttt{10} type \texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ 10}
and click the button \emph{Run} yet again. The new variable should have
appeared in the environment pane on the top right. The console however
did not show any results, because our line of code did not contain any
call that creates output. When you now type \texttt{x} in the console
and hit return, you ask \texttt{R} to show you the value of \texttt{x}
and the corresponding value should be printed in the console.

\texttt{x} is a scalar, a vector of length \(1\). You can easily create
longer vectors by using the function \texttt{c()} (\emph{c} for
``concatenate'' or ``combine''). To create a vector \texttt{y}
containing the numbers \(1\) to \(5\) and print it, do the following.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}

You can also create a vector of letters or words. For now just remember
that characters have to be surrounded by quotes, else wise they will be
parsed as object names.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{hello <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Hello"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"World"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we have created a vector of length 2 containing the words
\texttt{Hello} and \texttt{World}.

Do not forget to save your script! To do so, select \emph{File},
\emph{Save}.

\subsubsection*{Functions}\label{functions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Functions}

You have seen the function \texttt{c()} that can be used to combine
objects. In general, function calls look all the same, a function name
is always followed by round parentheses. Sometimes, the parentheses
include arguments

Here are two simple examples.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{z <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{seq}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{from =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{to =} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{by =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}

\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ z)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3
\end{verbatim}

In the first line we use a function called \texttt{seq()} to create the
exact same vector as we did in the previous section but naming it
\texttt{z}. The function takes on the arguments \texttt{from},
\texttt{to} and \texttt{by} which should be self-explaining. The
function \texttt{mean()} computes the arithmetic mean of its argument
\texttt{x}. Since we pass the vector \texttt{z} as the argument
\texttt{x}, the result is \texttt{3}!

If you are not sure which arguments a function expects, you may consult
the function's documentation. Let's say we are not sure how the
arguments required for \texttt{seq()} work. Then we may type
\texttt{?seq} in the console and by hitting return the documentation
page for that function pops up in the lower right pane of
\emph{RStudio}. In there, the section \emph{Arguments} holds the
information we seek.

On the bottom of almost every help page you find examples on how to use
the corresponding functions. This is very helpful for beginners and we
recommend to look out for those.

\chapter{Probability Theory}\label{pt}

This chapter reviews some basic concepts of probability theory and
demonstrates how they can be applied in \texttt{R}.

Most of the statistical functionalities in \texttt{R}'s standard version
are collected in the \texttt{stats} package. It provides simple
functions which compute descriptive measures and facilitate calculus
involving a variety of probability distributions. However, it also holds
more sophisticated routines that e.g.~enable the user to estimate a
large number of models based on the same data or help to conduct
extensive simulation studies. \texttt{stats} is part of the base
distribution of \texttt{R}, meaning that it is installed by default so
there is no need to run \texttt{install.packages("stats")} or
\texttt{library("stats")}. Simply execute
\texttt{library(help\ =\ "stats")} in the console to view the
documentation and a complete list of all functions gathered in
\texttt{stats}. For most packages a documentation that can be viewed
within \emph{RStudio} is available. Documentations can be invoked using
the \texttt{?} operator, e.g.~upon execution of \texttt{?stats} the
documentation of the \texttt{stats} package is shown in the help tab of
the bottom-right pane.

In what follows, we lay our focus on (some of) the probability
distributions that are handled by \texttt{R} and show how to use the
relevant functions to solve simple problems. Thereby we will repeat some
core concepts of probability theory. Among other things, you will learn
how to draw random numbers, how to compute densities, probabilities,
quantiles and alike. As we shall see, it is very convenient to rely on
these routines, especially when writing custom functions.

\section{Random Variables and Probability
Distributions}\label{random-variables-and-probability-distributions}

For a start, let us briefly review some basic concepts of probability
theory.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The mutually exclusive results of a random process are called the
  \emph{outcomes}. `Mutually exclusive' means that only one of the
  possible outcomes is observed.
\item
  We refer to the \emph{probability} of an outcome as the proportion of
  the time that the outcome occurs in the long run, that is, if the
  experiment is repeated very often.
\item
  The set of all possible outcomes of a random variable is called the
  \emph{sample space}.
\item
  An \emph{event} is a subset of the sample space and consists of one or
  more outcomes.
\end{itemize}

These ideas are unified in the concept of a \emph{random variable} which
is a numerical summary of random outcomes. Random variables can be
\emph{discrete} or \emph{continuous}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Discrete random variables have discrete outcomes, e.g. \(0\) and
  \(1\).
\item
  A continuous random variable takes on a continuum of possible values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Probability Distributions of Discrete Random
Variables}\label{probability-distributions-of-discrete-random-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Probability Distributions of Discrete
Random Variables}

A typical example for a discrete random variable \(D\) is the result of
a dice roll: in terms of a random experiment this is nothing but
randomly selecting a sample of size \(1\) from a set of numbers which
are mutually exclusive outcomes. Here, the sample space is
\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) and we can think of many different events, e.g. `the
observed outcome lies between \(2\) and \(5\)'.

A basic function to draw random samples from a specified set of elements
is the the function \texttt{sample()}, see \texttt{?sample}. We can use
it to simulate the random outcome of a dice roll. Let's role the dice!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{sample}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 3
\end{verbatim}

The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is the list
of all possible values of the variable and their probabilities which sum
to \(1\). The cumulative probability distribution function states the
probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a
particular value.

For the dice roll, the probability distribution and the cumulative
probability distribution are summarized in a Table \ref{tab:pdist}.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|l|l|l}

We can easily plot both functions using \texttt{R}. Since the
probability equals \(1/6\) for each outcome, we set up the vector
\texttt{probability} by using the function \texttt{rep()} which
replicates a given value a specified number of times.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Bernoulli Trials}

The set of elements from which \texttt{sample()} draws outcomes does not

The result of a single coin toss is a \emph{Bernoulli} distributed
random variable i.e.~a variable with two possible distinct outcomes.

Imagine you are about to toss a coin \(10\) times in a row and wonder
how likely it is to end up with a sequence of outcomes like

\[ H \, H \, T \, T \,T \,H \,T \,T \, H \, H .\]

This is a typical example of what we call a \emph{Bernoulli experiment}
as it consists of \(n=10\) Bernoulli trials that are independent of each
other and we are interested in the likelihood of observing \(k=5\)
successes \(H\) that occur with probability \(p=0.5\) (assuming a fair
coin) in each trial. Note that the order of the outcomes does not matter
here.

It is a well known result that the number of successes \(k\) in a
Bernoulli experiment follows a binomial distribution. We denote this as

\[k \sim B(n,p).\]

The probability of observing \(k\) successes in the experiment
\(B(n,p)\) is given by

\[f(k)=P(k)=\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k \end{pmatrix} \cdot p^k \cdot
q^{n-k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot p^k \cdot q^{n-k}\]

where \(\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k \end{pmatrix}\) means the binomial
coefficient.

In \texttt{R}, we can solve the problem stated above by means of the
function \texttt{dbinom()} which calculates the probability of the
binomial distribution given the parameters \texttt{x}, \texttt{size},
and \texttt{prob}, see \texttt{?binom}.

We conclude that the probability of observing Head \(k=5\) times when
tossing the coin \(n=10\) times is about \(24.6\%\).

Now assume we are interested in \(P(4 \leq k \leq 7)\) i.e.~the
probability of observing \(4\), \(5\), \(6\) or \(7\) successes for
\(B(10,0.5)\). This is easily computed by providing a vector as the
argument \texttt{x} in our call of \texttt{dbinom()} and summing up
using \texttt{sum()}.

\subsection*{Expected Value, Mean and
Variance}\label{expected-value-mean-and-variance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Expected Value, Mean and Variance}

The expected value of a random variable is the long-run average value of
its outcomes when the number of repeated trials is large. For a discrete
random variable, the expected value is computed as a weighted average of
its possible outcomes whereby the weights are the related probabilities.
This is formalized in Key Concept 2.1.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Expected Value and the Mean]{2.1}
Suppose the random variable $Y$
takes on $k$ possible values, $y_1, \dots, y_k$, where $y_1$ denotes the first
value, $y_2$ denotes the second value, and so forth, and that the probability
that $Y$ takes on $y_1$ is $p_1$, the probability that $Y$ takes on $y_2$ is
$p_2$ and so forth. The expected value of $Y$, $E(Y)$ is defined as

$$ E(Y) = y_1 p_1 + y_2 p_2 + \cdots + y_k p_k = \sum_{i=1}^k y_i p_i $$

where the notation $\sum_{i=1}^k y_i p_i$ means "the sum of $y_i$ $p_i$ for $i$
running from $1$ to $k$". The expected value of $Y$ is also called the mean of $Y$
or the expectation of $Y$ and is denoted by $\mu_y$.
\end{keyconcepts}

In the dice example, the random variable, \(D\) say, takes on \(6\)
possible values \(d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, \dots, d_6 = 6\). Assuming a fair
dice, each of the \(6\) outcomes occurs with a probability of \(1/6\).
It is therefore easy to calculate the exact value of \(E(D)\) by hand:

\[ E(D) = 1/6 \sum_{i=1}^6 d_i = 3.5 \]

\(E(D)\) is simply the average of the natural numbers from \(1\) to
\(6\) since all wights \(p_i\) are \(1/6\). Convince yourself that this
can be easily calculated using the function \texttt{mean()} which
computes the arithmetic mean of a numeric vector.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

An example of sampling with replacement is rolling a dice three times in
a row.

Of course we could also consider a much bigger number of trials,
\(10000\) say. Doing so, it would be pointless to simply print the
results to the console: by default \texttt{R} displays up to \(1000\)
entries of large vectors and omits the remainder (give it a go).
Eyeballing the numbers does not reveal too much. Instead let us
calculate the sample average of the outcomes using \texttt{mean()} and
see if the result comes close to the expected value \(E(D)=3.5\).

We find the sample mean to be fairly close to the expected value. This
result will be discussed in Chapter \ref{RSATDOSA} in more detail.

Other frequently encountered measures are the variance and the standard
deviation. Both are measures of the \emph{dispersion} of a random
variable.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Variance and Standard Deviation]{2.2}
The Variance of the discrete \textit{random variable} $Y$, denoted $\sigma^2_Y$, is
$$ \sigma^2_Y = \text{Var}(Y) = E\left[(Y-\mu_y)^2\right] = \sum_{i=1}^k (y_i - \mu_y)^2 p_i $$
The standard deviation of $Y$ is $\sigma_Y$, the square root of the variance. The units of the standard deviation are the same as the units of $Y$.
\end{keyconcepts}

The variance as defined in Key Concept 2.2 \emph{is not} implemented as
a function in R. Instead we have the function \texttt{var()} which
computes the \emph{sample variance}

\[ s^2_Y = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \overline{y})^2. \]

Remember that \(s^2_Y\) is different from the so called \emph{population
variance} of \(Y\),

\[ \text{Var}(Y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \mu_Y)^2, \]

since it measures how the data is dispersed around the sample average
\(\overline{y}\) instead of the population mean \(\mu_Y\). This becomes
clear when we look at our dice rolling example. For \(D\) we have

\[ \text{Var}(D) = 1/6 \sum_{i=1}^6 (d_i - 3.5)^2 = 2.92  \] which is
obviously different from the result of \(s^2\) as computed by
\texttt{var()}.

The sample variance as computed by \texttt{var()} is an \emph{estimator}
of the population variance.

\section{Probability Distributions of Continuous Random
Variables}\label{probability-distributions-of-continuous-random-variables}

Since a continuous random variable takes on a continuum of possible
values, we cannot use the concept of a probability distribution as used
for discrete random variables. Instead, the probability distribution of
a continuous random variable is summarized by its \emph{probability
density function} (PDF).

The cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) for a continuous
random variable is defined just as in the discrete case. Hence, the
cumulative probability distribution of a continuous random variables
states the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to
a particular value.

For completeness, we present revisions of Key Concepts 2.1 and 2.2 for
the continuous case.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Probabilities\comma Expected Value and Variance of a Continuous Random Variable]{2.3}
Let $f_Y(y)$ denote the probability density function of $Y$. Because probabilities cannot be negative, we have $f_Y\geq 0$ for all $y$. The Probability that $Y$ falls between $a$ and $b$ where $a < b$ is 
$$ P(a \leq Y \leq b) = \int_a^b f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y. $$
We further have that $P(-\infty \leq Y \leq \infty) = 1$ and therefore $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y = 1$.

As for the discrete case, the expected value of $Y$ is the probability weighted average of its values. Due to continuity, we use integrals instead of sums. The expected value of $Y$ is defined as

$$ E(Y) =  \mu_Y = \int y f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y. $$

The variance is the expected value of $(Y - \mu_Y)^2$. We thus have

$$\text{Var}(Y) =  \sigma_Y^2 = \int (y - \mu_Y)^2 f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y.$$
\end{keyconcepts}

Let us discuss an example:

Consider the continuous random variable \(X\) with probability density
function

\[ f_X(x) = \frac{3}{x^4}, x>1. \]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We can show analytically that the integral of \(f_X(x)\) over the real
  line equals \(1\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
 \int f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&  \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =& \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =& \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}  -x^{-3} \rvert_{x=1}^t \\
  =& -\left(\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{t^3} - 1\right) \\
  =& 1
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The expectation of \(X\) can be computed as follows:
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
 E(X) = \int x \cdot f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&  \int_{1}^{\infty} x \cdot \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =& - \frac{3}{2} x^{-2} \rvert_{x=1}^{\infty} \\
  =& -\frac{3}{2} \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t^2} - 1 \right) \\
  =& \frac{3}{2}
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that the variance of \(X\) can be expressed as
  \(\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2\). Since \(E(X)\) has been computed
  in the previous step, we seek \(E(X^2)\):
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
 E(X^2)= \int x^2 \cdot f_X(x) \mathrm{d}x =&  \int_{1}^{\infty} x^2 \cdot \frac{3}{x^4} \mathrm{d}x \\
  =& -3 x^{-1} \rvert_{x=1}^{\infty} \\
  =& -3 \left( \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} - 1 \right) \\
  =& 3
\end{align}

So we have shown that the area under the curve equals one, that the
expectation is \(E(X)=\frac{3}{2} \ \) and we found the variance to be
\(\text{Var}(X) = \frac{3}{4}\). However, this was quite tedious and, as
we shall see soon, an analytic approach is not applicable for some
probability density functions e.g.~if integrals have no closed form
solutions.

Luckily, \texttt{R} enables us to find the results derived above in an
instant. The tool we use for this is the function \texttt{integrate()}.
First, we have to define the functions we want to calculate integrals
for as \texttt{R} functions, i.e.~the PDF \(f_X(x)\) as well as the
expressions \(x\cdot f_X(x)\) and \(x^2\cdot f_X(x)\).

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, we use \texttt{integrate()} and set lower and upper limits of
integration to \(1\) and \(\infty\) using arguments \texttt{lower} and
\texttt{upper}. By default, \texttt{integrate()} prints the result along
with an estimate of the approximation error to the console. However, the
outcome is not a numeric value one can do further calculation with
readily. In order to get only a numeric value of the integral, we need
to use the \$ operator in conjunction with \texttt{value}.

Although there is a wide variety of distributions, the ones most often
encountered in econometrics are the normal, chi-squared, Student \(t\)
and \(F\) distributions. Therefore we will discuss some core \texttt{R}
functions that allow to do calculations involving densities,
probabilities and quantiles of these distributions.

Every probability distribution that \texttt{R} handles has four basic
functions whose names consist of a prefix followed by a root name. As an
example, take the normal distribution. The root name of all four
functions associated with the normal distribution is \texttt{norm}. The
four prefixes are

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{d} for ``density'' - probability function / probability
  density function
\item
  \texttt{p} for ``probability'' - cumulative distribution function
\item
  \texttt{q} for ``quantile'' - quantile function (inverse cumulative
  distribution function)
\item
  \texttt{r} for ``random'' - random number generator
\end{itemize}

Thus, for the normal distribution we have the \texttt{R} functions
\texttt{dnorm()}, \texttt{pnorm()}, \texttt{qnorm()} and
\texttt{rnorm()}.

\subsection*{The Normal Distribution}\label{the-normal-distribution}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Normal Distribution}

The probably most important probability distribution considered here is
the normal distribution. This is not least due to the special role of
the standard normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem which is
treated shortly during the course of this section. Distributions of the
normal family have a familiar symmetric, bell-shaped probability
density. A normal distribution is characterized by its mean \(\mu\) and
its standard deviation \(\sigma\) what is concisely expressed by
\(N(\mu,\sigma^2)\). The normal distribution has the PDF

\begin{align}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} e^{-(x - μ)^2/(2 σ^2)}.
\end{align}

For the standard normal distribution we have \(\mu=0\) and \(\sigma=1\).
Standard normal variates are often denoted by \(Z\). Usually, the
standard normal PDF is denoted by \(\phi\) and the standard normal CDF
is denoted by \(\Phi\). Hence,
\[ \phi(c) = \Phi'(c) \ \ , \ \ \Phi(c) = P(Z \leq c) \ \ , \ \ Z \sim N(0,1).\]
In \texttt{R}, we can conveniently obtain density values of normal
distributions using the function \texttt{dnorm()}. Let us draw a plot of
the standard normal density function using \texttt{curve()} in
conjunction with \texttt{dnorm()}.

associated with a standard normal variate.

Let us say we are interested in \(P(Z \leq 1,337)\). For some continuous
random variable \(Z\) on \([-\infty,\infty]\) with density function
\(g(x)\) we would have to determine \(G(x)\) which is the anti
derivative of \(g(x)\) so that

\[ P(Z \leq 1,337 ) = G(1,337) = \int_{-\infty}^{1,337} g(x) \mathrm{d}x.  \]

If \(Z \sim N(0,1)\), we have \(g(x)=\phi(x)\). There is no analytic
solution to the integral above and it is cumbersome to come up with an
approximation. However, we may circumvent this using \texttt{R} in
different ways. The first approach makes use of the function
\texttt{integrate()} which allows to solve one-dimensional integration
problems using a numerical method. For this, we first define the
function we want to compute the integral of as a \texttt{R} function
\texttt{f}. In our example, \texttt{f} needs to be the standard normal
density function and hence takes a single argument \texttt{x}. Following
the definition of \(\phi(x)\) we define \texttt{f} as

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# define the standard normal PDF as a R function}
\NormalTok{f <-}\StringTok{ }\ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(x) \{}
  \DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{pi)) }\OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{exp}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\FloatTok{0.5} \OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{x}\OperatorTok{^}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Let us check if this function enables us to compute standard normal
density values by passing it a vector of quantiles.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# define vector of quantiles}
\NormalTok{quants <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\FloatTok{1.96}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{1.96}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Notice that the results produced by \texttt{f()} are indeed equivalent
to those given by \texttt{dnorm()}.

Next, we call \texttt{integrate()} on \texttt{f()} and specify the
arguments \texttt{lower} and \texttt{upper}, the lower and upper limits
of integration.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# integrate f()}

\NormalTok{          )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 0.9093887 with absolute error < 1.7e-07
\end{verbatim}

We find that the probability of observing \(Z \leq 1.337\) is about
\(0.9094\%\).

A second and much more convenient way is to use the function
\texttt{pnorm()} which also allows calculus involving the standard
normal cumulative distribution function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# compute the probability using pnorm()}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.9093887
\end{verbatim}

The result matches the outcome of the approach using
\texttt{integrate()}.

Let us discuss some further examples:

A commonly known result is that \(95\%\) probability mass of a standard
normal lies in the interval \([-1.96, 1.96]\), that is in a distance of
about \(2\) standard deviations to the mean. We can easily confirm this
by calculating

\[ P(-1.96 \leq Z \leq 1.96) = 1-2\times P(Z \leq -1.96) \] due to
symmetry of the standard normal PDF. Thanks to \texttt{R}, we can
abandon the table of the standard normal CDF again and instead solve
this by using the function \texttt{pnorm()}.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

Now consider a random variable \(Y\) with \(Y \sim N(5, 25)\). To make
statements about the probability of observing outcomes of \(Y\) in some
specific range is more convenient without when we standardize first as
shown in Key Concept 2.4.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Computing Probabilities Involving Normal Random Variables]{2.4}

Suppose $Y$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$: $$Y
\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$ Then $Y$ is standardized by subtracting its mean and
dividing by its standard deviation: $$ Z = \frac{Y -\mu}{\sigma} $$ Let $c_1$
and $c_2$ denote two numbers whereby $c_1 < c_2$ and further $d_1 = (c_1 - \mu)
/ \sigma$ and $d_2 = (c_2 - \mu)/\sigma$. Then
\begin{align*} 
P(Y \leq c_2) =& \, P(Z \leq d_2) = \Phi(d_2) \\ 
P(Y \geq c_1) =& \, P(Z \geq d_1) = 1 - \Phi(d_1) \\ 
P(c_1 \leq Y \leq c_2) =& \, P(d_1 \leq Z \leq d_2) = \Phi(d_2) - \Phi(d_1). 
\end{align*}
\end{keyconcepts}

\texttt{R} functions that handle the normal distribution can perform
this standardization. If we are interested in \(P(3 \leq Y \leq 4)\) we
can use \texttt{pnorm()} and adjust for a mean and/or a standard
deviation that deviate from \(\mu=0\) and \(\sigma = 1\) by specifying
the arguments \texttt{mean} and \texttt{sd} accordingly.
\textbf{Attention}: the argument \texttt{sd} requires the standard
deviation, not the variance!

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.07616203
\end{verbatim}

An extension of the normal distribution in a univariate setting is the
multivariate normal distribution. The PDF of two random normal variables
\(X\) and \(Y\) is given by

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
g_{X,Y}(x,y) =& \, \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_X\sigma_Y\sqrt{1-\rho_{XY}^2}} \\ 
\cdot & \, \exp \left\{ \frac{1}{-2(1-\rho_{XY}^2)} \left[ \left( \frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x} \right)^2 - 2\rho_{XY}\left( \frac{x-\mu_X}{\sigma_X} \right)\left( \frac{y-\mu_Y}{\sigma_Y} \right) + \left( \frac{y-\mu_Y}{\sigma_Y} \right)^2 \right]  \right\}.
\end{split} \label{eq:bivnorm}
\end{align}

Equation \eqref{eq:bivnorm} contains the bivariate normal PDF. Admittedly,
it is hard to gain insights from this complicated expression. Instead,
let us consider the special case where \(X\) and \(Y\) are uncorrelated
standard normal random variables with density functions \(f_X(x)\) and
\(f_Y(y)\) and we assume that they have a joint normal distribution. We
then have the parameters \(\sigma_X = \sigma_Y = 1\), \(\mu_X=\mu_Y=0\)
(due to marginal standard normality) and \(\rho_{XY}=0\) (due to
independence). The joint probability density function of \(X\) and \(Y\)
then becomes

\[ g_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot \exp \left\{ -\frac{1}{2} \left[x^2 + y^2 \right]  \right\}, \tag{2.2}  \]

the PDF of the bivariate standard normal distribution. The next plot
provides an interactive three-dimensional plot of (2.2). By moving the
cursor over the plot you can see that the density is rotationally
invariant.

\subsection*{The Chi-Squared
Distribution}\label{the-chi-squared-distribution}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Chi-Squared Distribution}

Another distribution relevant in econometric day-to-day work is the
chi-squared distribution. It is often needed when testing special types
of hypotheses frequently encountered when dealing with regression
models.

The sum of \(M\) squared independent standard normal distributed random
variables follows a chi-squared distribution with \(M\) degrees of
freedom.

\[ Z_1^2 + \dots + Z_M^2 = \sum_{m=1}^M Z_m^2 \sim \chi^2_M \ \ \text{with} \ \ Z_m \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,1) \label{eq:chisq}\]

A \(\chi^2\) distributed random variable with \(M\) degrees of freedom
has expectation \(M\), mode at \(M-2\) for \(n \geq 2\) and variance
\(2 \cdot M\).

For example, if we have

\[ Z_1,Z_2,Z_3 \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,1) \]

it holds that

\[ Z_1^2+Z_2^2+Z_3^3 \sim \chi^2_3. \tag{2.3} \] Using the code below,
we can display the PDF and the CDF of a \(\chi^2_3\) random variable in
a single plot. This is achieved by setting the argument
\texttt{add = TRUE} in the second call of \texttt{curve()}. Further we
adjust limits of both axes using \texttt{xlim} and \texttt{ylim} and
choose different colors to make both functions better distinguishable.
The plot is completed by adding a legend with help of the function
\texttt{legend()}.

Since the outcomes of a \(\chi^2_M\) distributed random variable are
always positive, the domain of the related PDF and CDF is
\(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\).

As expectation and variance depend (solely!) on the degrees of freedom,
the distribution's shape changes drastically if we vary the number of
squared standard normals that are summed up. This relation is often
depicted by overlaying densities for different \(M\), see e.g.~the
Wikipedia Article.

Start by plotting the density of the \(\chi_1^2\) distribution on the
interval \([0,15]\) with \texttt{curve()}. In the next step, we loop
over degrees of freedom \(m=2,...,7\) and add a density curve for each
\(m\) to the plot. We also adjust the line color for each iteration of
the loop by setting \texttt{col = m}. At last, we add a legend that
displays degrees of freedom and the associated colors.

It is evident that increasing the degrees of freedom shifts the
distribution to the right (the mode becomes larger) and increases the
dispersion (the distribution's variance grows).

\hypertarget{thetdist}{\subsection*{The Student t
Distribution}\label{thetdist}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Student t Distribution}

Let \(Z\) be a standard normal variate, \(W\) a random variable that
follows a \(\chi^2_M\) distribution with \(M\) degrees of freedom and
further assume that \(Z\) and \(W\) are independently distributed. Then
it holds that

\[ \frac{Z}{\sqrt{W/M}} =:X \sim t_M \] and we say that \(X\) follows a
\emph{Student \(t\) distribution} (or simply \(t\) distribution) with
\(M\) degrees of freedom.

Similar to the \(\chi^2_M\) distribution, the shape of a \(t_M\)
distribution depends on \(M\). \(t\) distributions are symmetric,
bell-shaped and look very similar to a normal distribution, especially
when \(M\) is large. This is not a coincidence: for a sufficient large
\(M\), the \(t_M\) distribution can be approximated by the standard
normal distribution. This approximation works reasonably well for
\(M\geq 30\). As we will show later by means of a small simulation
study, the \(t_{\infty}\) distribution \emph{is} the standard normal
distribution.

A \(t_M\) distributed random variable has an expectation if \(M>1\) and
it has a variance if \(M>2\).

\begin{align}
  E(X) =& 0 \ , \ M>1 \\
  \text{Var}(X) =& \frac{M}{M-2} \ , \ M>2
\end{align}

them to the standard normal distribution.

The plot indicates what has been claimed in the previous paragraph: as
the degrees of freedom increase, the shape of the \(t\) distribution
comes closer to that of a standard normal bell. Already for \(M=25\) we
find little difference to the standard normal density. If \(M\) is
small, we find the distribution to have slightly heavier tails than a
standard normal, i.e.~it has a ``fatter'' bell shape.

\subsection*{The F Distribution}\label{the-f-distribution}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The F Distribution}

Another ratio of random variables important to econometricians is the
ratio of two independently \(\chi^2\) distributed random variables that
are divided by their degrees of freedom \(M\) and \(n\). The quantity

\[ \frac{W/M}{V/n} \sim F_{M,n} \ \ \text{with} \ \ W \sim \chi^2_M \ \ , \ \ V \sim \chi^2_n \]
follows an \(F\) distribution with numerator degrees of freedom \(M\)
and denominator degrees of freedom \(n\), denoted \(F_{M,n}\). The
distribution was first derived by George Snedecor but was named in honor
of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher}{Sir Ronald
Fisher}.

By definition, the domain of both PDF and CDF of an \(F_{M,n}\)
distributed random variable is \(\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\).

Say we have an \(F\) distributed random variable \(Y\) with numerator
degrees of freedom \(3\) and denominator degrees of freedom \(14\) and
are interested in \(P(Y \geq 2)\). This can be computed with help of the
function \texttt{pf()}. By setting the argument \texttt{lower.tail} to
\texttt{TRUE} we ensure that \texttt{R} computes \(1- P(Y \leq 2)\),
i.e.~the probability mass in the tail right of \(2\).

The \(F\) distribution is related to many other distributions. An
important special case encountered in econometrics arises if the
denominator degrees of freedom are large such that the \(F_{M,n}\)
distribution can be approximated by the \(F_{M,\infty}\) distribution
which turns out to be simply the distribution of a \(\chi^2_M\) random
variable divided by its degrees of freedom \(M\),

\[ W/M \sim F_{M,\infty} \ \ , \ \ W \sim \chi^2_M. \]

\section{Random Sampling and the Distribution of Sample
Averages}\label{RSATDOSA}

To clarify the basic idea of random sampling, let us jump back to the
dice rolling example:

Suppose we are rolling the dice \(n\) times. This means we are
interested in the outcomes of \(n\) random processes
\(Y_i, \ i=1,...,n\) which are characterized by the same distribution.
Since these outcomes are selected randomly, they are \emph{random
variables} themselves and their realizations will differ each time we
draw a sample, i.e.~each time we roll the dice \(n\) times. Furthermore,
each observation is randomly drawn from the same population, that is,
the numbers from \(1\) to \(6\), and their individual distribution is
the same. Hence we say that \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) are identically
distributed. Moreover, we know that the value of any of the \(Y_i\) does
not provide any information on the remainder of the sample. In our
example, rolling a six as the first observation in our sample does not
alter the distributions of \(Y_2,\dots,Y_n\): all numbers are equally
likely to occur. This means that all \(Y_i\) are also independently
distributed. Thus, we say that \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) are independently and
identically distributed (\emph{i.i.d}). The dice example uses the most
simple sampling scheme. That is why it is called \emph{simple random
sampling}. This concept is condensed in Key Concept 2.5.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Simple Random Sampling and i.i.d. Random Variables]{2.5}
In simple random sampling, $n$ objects are drawn at random from a population. Each object is equally likely to end up in the sample. We denote the value of the random variable $Y$ for the $i^{th}$ randomly drawn object as $Y_i$.  Since all objects are equally likely to be drawn and the distribution of $Y_i$ is the same for all $i$, the $Y_i, \dots, Y_n$ are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This means the distribution of $Y_i$ is the same for all $i=1,\dots,n$ and $Y_1$ is distributed independently of $Y_2, \dots, Y_n$ and $Y_2$ is distributed independently of $Y_1, Y_3, \dots, Y_n$ and so forth.
\end{keyconcepts}

What happens if we consider functions of the sample data? Consider the
example of rolling a dice two times in a row once again. A sample now
consists of two independent random draws from the set
\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\). In view of the aforementioned, it is apparent that
any function of these two random variables is also random, e.g.~their
sum. Convince yourself by executing the code below several times.

Clearly this sum, let us call it \(S\), is a random variable as it
depends on randomly drawn summands. For this example, we can completely
enumerate all outcomes and hence write down the theoretical probability
distribution of our function of the sample data, \(S\):

We face \(6^2=36\) possible pairs. Those pairs are

\begin{align}
  &(1,1)    (1,2)   (1,3)   (1,4)   (1,5)   (1,6) \\ 
  &(2,1)    (2,2)   (2,3)   (2,4)   (2,5)   (2,6) \\ 
  &(3,1)    (3,2)   (3,3)   (3,4)   (3,5)   (3,6) \\ 
  &(4,1)    (4,2)   (4,3)   (4,4)   (4,5)   (4,6) \\ 
  &(5,1)    (5,2)   (5,3)   (5,4)   (5,5)   (5,6) \\ 
  &(6,1)    (6,2)   (6,3)   (6,4)   (6,5)   (6,6)
\end{align}

Thus, possible outcomes for \(S\) are

\[ \left\{ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \right\} . \] Enumeration of
outcomes yields

\begin{align}
  P(S) = 
  \begin{cases} 
    1/36, \ & S = 2 \\ 
    2/36, \ & S = 3 \\
    3/36, \ & S = 4 \\
    4/36, \ & S = 5 \\
    5/36, \ & S = 6 \\
    6/36, \ & S = 7 \\
    5/36, \ & S = 8 \\
    4/36, \ & S = 9 \\
    3/36, \ & S = 10 \\
    2/36, \ & S = 11 \\
    1/36, \ & S = 12
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

We can also compute \(E(S)\) and \(\text{Var}(S)\) as stated in Key
Concept 2.1 and Key Concept 2.2.

So the distribution of \(S\) is known. It is also evident that its
distribution differs considerably from the marginal distribution,

Many econometric procedures deal with averages of sampled data. It is
almost always assumed that observations are drawn randomly from a
larger, unknown population. As demonstrated for the sample function
\(S\), computing an average of a random sample also has the effect to
make the average a random variable itself. This random variable in turn
has a probability distribution which is called the sampling
distribution. Knowledge about the sampling distribution of the average
is therefore crucial for understanding the performance of econometric
procedures.

The \emph{sample average} of a sample of \(n\) observations
\(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\) is

\[ \overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = \frac{1}{n} (Y_1 + Y_2 + \cdots + Y_n). \]
\(\overline{Y}\) is also called the sample mean.

\subsection*{Mean and Variance of the Sample
Mean}\label{mean-and-variance-of-the-sample-mean}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Mean and Variance of the Sample Mean}

Denote \(\mu_Y\) and \(\sigma_Y^2\) the mean and the variance of the
\(Y_i\) and suppose that all observations \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) are i.i.d.
such that in particular mean and variance are the same for all
\(i=1,\dots,n\). Then we have that

\[ E(\overline{Y}) = E\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \right) = \frac{1}{n} E\left(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\right) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E\left(Y_i\right) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \cdot \mu_Y = \mu_Y    \]
and

\begin{align}
  \text{Var}(\overline{Y}) =& \text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \right) \\
  =& \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Var}(Y_i) + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1, j\neq i}^n \text{cov}(Y_i,Y_j) \\
  =& \frac{\sigma^2_Y}{n} \\
  =& \sigma_{\overline{Y}}^2.
\end{align}

Note that the second summand vanishes since \(\text{cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=0\)
for \(i\neq j\) due to independence of the observations.

Consequently, the standard deviation of the sample mean is given by

\[ \sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sqrt{n}}. \]

It is worthwhile to mention that these results hold irrespective of the
underlying distribution of the \(Y_i\).

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{The Sampling Distribution of
\(\overline{Y}\) when \(Y\) Is Normally
Distributed}{The Sampling Distribution of \textbackslash{}overline\{Y\} when Y Is Normally Distributed}}\label{the-sampling-distribution-of-overliney-when-y-is-normally-distributed}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{The Sampling Distribution of
\(\overline{Y}\) when \(Y\) Is Normally Distributed}

If the \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) are i.i.d. draws from a normal distribution
with mean \(\mu_Y\) and variance \(\sigma_Y^2\), the following holds for
their sample average \(\overline{Y}\):

\[ \overline{Y} \sim N(\mu_y, \sigma_Y^2/n) \tag{2.4} \]

For example, if a sample \(Y_i\) with \(i=1,\dots,10\) is drawn from a
standard normal distribution with mean \(\mu_Y = 0\) and variance
\(\sigma_Y^2=1\) we have

\[ \overline{Y} \sim N(0,0.1).\]

We can use \texttt{R}'s random number generation facilities to verify
this result. The basic idea is to simulate outcomes of the true
distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) by repeatedly drawing random samples of
10 observation from the \(N(0,1)\) distribution and computing their
respective averages. If we do this for a large number of repetitions,
the simulated data set of averages should quite accurately reflect the
theoretical distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) if the theoretical result
holds.

The approach sketched above is an example of what is commonly known as
\emph{Monte Carlo Simulation} or \emph{Monte Carlo Experiment}. To
perform this simulation in \texttt{R}, we proceed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose a sample size \texttt{n} and the number of samples to be drawn
  \texttt{reps}.
\item
  Use the function \texttt{replicate()} in conjunction with
  \texttt{rnorm()} to draw \texttt{n} observations from the standard
  normal distribution \texttt{rep} times. \textbf{Note}: the outcome of
  \texttt{replicate()} is a matrix with dimensions \texttt{n} \(\times\)
  \texttt{rep}. It contains the drawn samples as \emph{columns}.
\item
  Compute sample means using \texttt{colMeans()}. This function computes
  the mean of each column i.e.~of each sample and returns a vector.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After performing these steps we end up with a vector of sample averages.
You can check the vector property of \texttt{sample.avgs}:

\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

A straightforward approach to examine the distribution of univariate
numerical data is to plot it as a histogram and compare it to some known
or assumed distribution. This comparison can be done with help of a
suitable statistical test or by simply eyeballing some graphical
representations of these distributions. For our simulated sample
averages, we will do the latter by means of the functions
\texttt{hist()} and \texttt{curve()}.

By default, \texttt{hist()} will give us a frequency histogram i.e.~a
bar chart where observations are grouped into ranges, also called bins.
The ordinate reports the number of observations falling into each of the
bins. Instead, we want it to report density estimates for comparison
purposes. This is achieved by setting the argument
\texttt{freq = FALSE}. The number of bins is adjusted by the argument
\texttt{breaks}.

Using \texttt{curve()}, we overlay the histogram with a red line which
represents the theoretical density of a \(N(0, 0.1)\) distributed random
variable. Remember to use the argument \texttt{add = TRUE} to add the
curve to the current plot. Otherwise \texttt{R} will open a new graphic
device and discard the previous plot!

\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-57-1} \end{center}

From inspection of the plot we can tell that the distribution of
\(\overline{Y}\) is indeed very close to that of a \(N(0, 0.1)\)
distributed random variable so that evidence obtained from the Monte
Carlo Simulation supports the theoretical claim.

Let us discuss another example where using simple random sampling in a
simulation setup helps to verify a well known result. As discussed
before, the \protect\hyperlink{chisquare}{Chi-squared} distribution with
\(m\) degrees of freedom arises as the distribution of the sum of \(m\)
independent squared standard normal distributed random variables.

To visualize the claim stated in equation (2.3), we proceed similarly as
in the example before:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose the degrees of freedom \texttt{DF} and the number of samples to
  be drawn \texttt{reps}.
\item
  Draw \texttt{reps} random samples of size \texttt{DF} from the
  standard normal distribution using \texttt{replicate()}.
\item
  For each sample, by squaring the outcomes and summing them up column
  wise. Store the results
\end{enumerate}

Again, we produce a density estimate for the distribution underlying our
simulated data using a density histogram and overlay it with a line
graph of the theoretical density function of the \(\chi^2_3\)
distribution.

\subsection*{Large Sample Approximations to Sampling
Distributions}\label{large-sample-approximations-to-sampling-distributions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Large Sample Approximations to
Sampling Distributions}

Sampling distributions as considered in the last section play an
important role in the development of econometric methods. In general,
there are two different approaches in characterizing sampling
distributions: an ``exact'' approach and an ``approximate'' approach.

The exact approach aims to find a general formula for the sampling
distribution that holds for any sample size \(n\). We call this the
\emph{exact distribution} or \emph{finite sample distribution}. In the
previous examples of dice rolling and normal variates, we have dealt
with functions of random variables whose sample distributions are
\emph{excactly known} in the sense that we can write them down as
analytic expressions and do calculations. However, this is not always
possible. For \(\overline{Y}\), result (2.4) tells us that normality of
the \(Y_i\) implies normality of \(\overline{Y}\) (we demonstrated this
for the special case of \(Y_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,1)\) with
\(n=10\) using a simulation study that involves simple random sampling).
Unfortunately, the \emph{exact} distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) is
generally unknown and often hard to derive (or even untraceable) if we
drop the assumption that the \(Y_i\) have a normal distribution.

Therefore, as can be guessed from its name, the ``approximate'' approach
aims to find an approximation to the sampling distribution whereby it is
required that the sample size \(n\) is large. A distribution that is
used as a large-sample approximation to the sampling distribution is
also called the \emph{asymptotic distribution}. This is due to the fact
that the asymptotic distribution \emph{is} the sampling distribution for
\(n \rightarrow \infty\) i.e.~the approximation becomes exact if the
sample size goes to infinity. However, there are cases where the
difference between the sampling distribution and the asymptotic
distribution is negligible for moderate or even small samples sizes so
that approximations using the asymptotic distribution are reasonably
good.

In this section we will discuss two well known results that are used to
approximate sampling distributions and thus constitute key tools in
econometric theory: the \emph{law of large numbers} and the
\emph{central limit theorem}. The law of large numbers states that in
large samples, \(\overline{Y}\) is close to \(\mu_Y\) with high
probability. The central limit theorem says that the sampling
distribution of the standardized sample average, that is,
\((\overline{Y} - \mu_Y)/\sigma_{\overline{Y}}\) is asymptotically
normally distributed. It is particularly interesting that both results
do not depend on the distribution of \(Y\). In other words, being unable
to describe the complicated sampling distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) if
\(Y\) is not normal, approximations of the latter using the central
limit theorem simplify the development and applicability of econometric
procedures enormously. This is a key component underlying the theory of
statistical inference for regression models. Both results are summarized
in Key Concept 2.6 and Key Concept 2.7.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Convergence in Probability\comma Consistency and the Law of Large Numbers]{2.6}
The sample average $\overline{Y}$ converges in probability to $\mu_Y$ --- we say that $\overline{Y}$ is \textit{consistent} for $\mu_Y$ --- if the probability that $\overline{Y}$ is in the range $(\mu_Y - \epsilon)$ to $(\mu_Y + \epsilon)$ becomes arbitrary close to $1$ as $n$ increases for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. We write this short as

$$ \overline{Y} \xrightarrow[]{p} \mu_Y. $$

Consider the independently and identically distributed random variables $Y_i, i=1,\dots,n$ with expectation $E(Y_i)=\mu_Y$ and variance $\text{Var}(Y_i)=\sigma^2_Y$. Under the condition that $\sigma^2_Y< \infty$, that is, large outliers are unlikely, the law of large numbers states

$$ \overline{Y} \xrightarrow[]{p} \mu_Y. $$

The following application simulates a large number of coin tosses (you may set the number of trials using the slider) with a fair coin and computes the fraction of heads observed for each additional toss. The result is a random path that, as stated by the law of large numbers, shows a tendency to approach the value of $0.5$ as $n$ grows.\newline
\begin{center}
\textit{This interactive application is only available in the HTML version.}
\end{center}
\end{keyconcepts}

The core statement of the law of large numbers is that under quite
general conditions, the probability of obtaining a sample average
\(\overline{Y}\) that is close to \(\mu_Y\) is high if we have a large
sample size.

Consider the example of repeatedly tossing a coin where \(Y_i\) is the
result of the \(i^{th}\) coin toss. \(Y_i\) is a Bernoulli distributed
random variable with

\[ P(Y_i) = \begin{cases} p, & Y_i = 1 \\ 1-p, & Y_i = 0 \end{cases} \]
where \(p = 0.5\) as we assume a fair coin. It is straightforward to
show that

\[ \mu_Y = p = 0.5. \] Say \(p\) is the probability of observing head
and denote \(R_n\) the proportion of heads in the first \(n\) tosses,

\[ R_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i. \tag{2.5}\]

According to the law of large numbers, the observed proportion of heads
converges in probability to \(\mu_Y = 0.5\), the probability of tossing
head in a \emph{single} coin toss,

\[ R_n \xrightarrow[]{p} \mu_Y=0.5 \ \ \text{as} \ \ n \rightarrow \infty.  \]

We can use \texttt{R} to compute and illustrate such paths by
simulation. The procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sample \texttt{N} observations from the Bernoulli distribution
  e.g.~using \texttt{sample()}.
\item
  Calculate the proportion of heads \(R_n\) as in (2.5). A way to
  achieve this is to call \texttt{cumsum()} on the vector of
  observations \texttt{Y} to obtain its cumulative sum and then divide
  by the respective number of observations.
\end{enumerate}

We continue by plotting the path and also add a dashed line for the
benchmark probability \(R_n = p = 0.5\).

There are several things to be said about this plot.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The blue graph shows the observed proportion of heads when tossing a
  coin \(n\) times.
\item
  Since the \(Y_i\) are random variables, \(R_n\) is a random variate,
  too. The path depicted is only one of many possible realizations of
  \(R_n\) as it is determined by the \(30000\) observations sampled from
  the Bernoulli distribution. Thus, the code chunk above produces a
  different path every time you execute it (try this below!).
\item
  If the number of coin tosses \(n\) is small, we observe the proportion
  of heads to be anything but close to its theoretical value,
  \(\mu_Y = 0.5\). However, as more and more observation are included in
  the sample we find that the path stabilizes in neighborhood of
  \(0.5\). This is the message to take away: the average of multiple
  trials shows a clear tendency to converge to its expected value as the
  sample size increases, just as claimed by the law of large numbers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Central Limit Theorem]{2.7}
Suppose that $Y_1,\dots,Y_n$ are independently and identically distributed random variables with expectation $E(Y_i)=\mu_Y$ and variance $\text{Var}(Y_i)=\sigma^2_Y$ where $0<\sigma^2_Y<\infty$.<br>
The central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that, if the sample size $n$ goes to infinity, the distribution of the standardized sample average 
$$ \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_Y}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}} = \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_Y}{\sigma_Y/\sqrt{n}} \ $$
becomes arbitrarily well approximated by the standard normal distribution.

The application below demonstrates the CLT for the sample average of normally distributed random variables with mean $5$ and variance $25^2$. You may check the following properties:\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item The distribution of the sample average is normal.
\item As the sample size increases, the distribution of $\overline{Y}$ tightens around the true mean of $5$.
\item The distribution of the standardized sample average is close to the standard normal distribution for large $n$.
\end{itemize}

According to the central limit theorem, the distribution of the sample
mean \(\overline{Y}\) of the Bernoulli distributed random variables
\(Y_i\), \(i=1,...,n\) is well approximated by the normal distribution
with parameters \(\mu_Y=p=0.5\) and
\(\sigma^2_{\overline{Y}} = p(1-p) = 0.25\) for large \(n\).
Consequently, for the standardized sample mean we conclude that the
ratio

\[ \frac{\overline{Y} - 0.5}{0.5/\sqrt{n}} \tag{2.6}\] should be well
approximated by the standard normal distribution \(N(0,1)\). We employ
another simulation study to demonstrate this graphically. The idea is as
follows.

Draw a large number of random samples, \(10000\) say, of size \(n\) from
the Bernoulli distribution and compute the sample averages. Standardize
the averages as shown in (2.6). Next, visualize the distribution of the
generated standardized sample averages by means of a density histogram
and compare to the standard normal distribution. Repeat this for
different sample sizes \(n\) to see how increasing the sample size \(n\)
impacts the simulated distribution of the averages.

In R, we realized this as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We start by defining that the next four subsequently generated figures
  shall be drawn in a \(2\times2\) array such that they can be easily
  compared. This is done by calling \texttt{par(mfrow = c(2, 2))} before
  the figures are generated.
\item
  We define the number of repetitions \texttt{reps} as \(10000\) and
  create a vector of sample sizes named \texttt{sample.sizes}. We
  consider samples of sizes \(2\), \(10\), \(50\) and \(100\).
\item
  Next, we combine two \texttt{for()} loops to simulate the data and
  plot the distributions. The inner loop generates \(10000\) random
  samples, each consisting of \texttt{n} observations that are drawn
  from the Bernoulli distribution, and computes the standardized
  averages. The outer loop executes the inner loop for the different
  sample sizes \texttt{n} and produces a plot for each iteration.

We see that the simulated sampling distribution of the standardized
average tends to deviate strongly from the standard normal distribution
if the sample size is small, e.g.~for \(n=5\) and \(n=10\). However as
\(n\) grows, the histograms are approaching the bell shape of a standard
normal and we can be confident that the approximation works quite well
as seen for \(n=100\).

\chapter{A Review of Statistics using R}\label{arosur}

This section reviews important statistical concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Estimation of unknown population parameters
\item
  Hypothesis testing
\item
  Confidence intervals
\end{itemize}

Since these types of statistical methods are heavily used in
econometrics, we will discuss them in the context of inference about an
unknown population mean and discuss several applications in \texttt{R}.
These \texttt{R} applications rely on the following packages which are
not part of the base version of \texttt{R}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{readxl} - allows to import data from \emph{Excel} to
  \texttt{R}.
\item
  \texttt{dplyr} - provides a flexible grammar for data manipulation.
\item
  \texttt{MASS} - a collection of functions for applied statistics.
\end{itemize}

Make sure these are installed before you go ahead and try to replicate
the examples. The safest way to do so is by checking whether the
following code chunk executes without any errors.

\section{Estimation of the Population
Mean}\label{estimation-of-the-population-mean}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Estimators and Estimates]{3.1}
\textit{Estimators} are functions of sample data that are drawn randomly from an unknown population. \textit{Estimates} are numeric values computed by estimators based on the sample data. Estimators are random variables because they are functions of \textit{random} data. Estimates are nonrandom numbers.
\end{keyconcepts}

Think of some economic variable, for example hourly earnings of college
graduates, denoted by \(Y\). Suppose we are interested in \(\mu_Y\) the
mean of \(Y\). In order to exactly calculate \(\mu_Y\) we would have to
interview every graduated member of the working population in the
economy. We simply cannot do this for time and cost reasons. However, we
could draw a random sample of \(n\) i.i.d. observations
\(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\) and estimate \(\mu_Y\) using one of the simplest
estimators in the sense of Key Concept 3.1 one can think of, that is,

\[ \overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i, \]

the sample mean of \(Y\). Then again, we could use an even simpler
estimator for \(\mu_Y\): the very first observation in the sample,
\(Y_1\). Is \(Y_1\) a good estimator? For now, assume that

\[ Y \sim \chi_{12}^2 \]

which is not too unreasonable as hourly income is non-negative and we
expect many hourly earnings to be in a range of \(5€\,\) to \(15€\).
Moreover, it is common for income distributions to be skewed to the
right --- a property of the \(\chi^2_{12}\) distribution.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-83-1} \end{center}

We now draw a sample of \(n=100\) observations and take the first
observation \(Y_1\) as an estimate for \(\mu_Y\)

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 8.257893
\end{verbatim}

The estimate \(8.26\) is not too far away from \(\mu_Y = 12\) but it is
somewhat intuitive that we could do better: the estimator \(Y_1\)
discards a lot of information and its variance is the population
variance:

\[ \text{Var}(Y_1) = \text{Var}(Y) = 2 \cdot 12 = 24 \]

This brings us to the following question: What is a \emph{good}
estimator of an unknown parameter in the first place? This question is
tackled in Key Concepts 3.2 and 3.3

\begin{keyconcepts}[Bias\comma Consistency and Efficiency]{3.2}
Desirable characteristics of an estimator are unbiasedness, consistency and efficiency.\newline

\textbf{Unbiasedness:}

If the mean of the sampling distribution of some estimator $\hat\mu_Y$ for the population mean $\mu_Y$ equals $\mu_Y$
$$ E(\hat\mu_Y) = \mu_Y $$
we say that the estimator is unbiased for $\mu_Y$. The \textit{bias} of $\hat\mu_Y$ is $0$:

$$ E(\hat\mu_Y) - \mu_Y = 0$$

\textbf{Consistency:}

We want the uncertainty of the estimator $\mu_Y$ to decrease as the number of observations in the sample grows. More precisely, we want the probability that the estimate $\hat\mu_Y$ falls within a small interval of the true value $\mu_Y$ to get increasingly closer to $1$ as $n$ grows. We write this as

$$ \hat\mu_Y \xrightarrow{p} \mu_Y. $$

\textbf{Variance and efficiency:}

We want the estimator to be efficient. Suppose we have two estimators, $\hat\mu_Y$ and $\overset{\sim}{\mu}_Y$ and for some given sample size $n$ it holds that

$$ E(\hat\mu_Y) = E(\overset{\sim}{\mu}_Y) = \mu_Y $$
but
$$\text{Var}(\hat\mu_Y) < \text{Var}(\overset{\sim}{\mu}_Y).$$

We then would prefer to use $\hat\mu_Y$ as it has a lower variance than $\overset{\sim}{\mu}_Y$, meaning that $\hat\mu_Y$ is more \textit{efficient} in using the information provided by the observations in the sample.
\end{keyconcepts}

\section{Properties of the Sample Mean}\label{potsm}

To examine properties of the sample mean as an estimator for the
corresponding population mean, consider the following \texttt{R}example.

We generate a population \texttt{pop} which consists observations
\(Y_i \ , \ i=1,\dots,10000\) that origin from a normal distribution
with mean \(\mu = 10\) and variance \(\sigma^2 = 1\). To investigate how
the estimator \(\hat{\mu} = \bar{Y}\) behaves we can draw random samples
from this population and calculate \(\bar{Y}\) for each of them. This is
easily done by making use of the function \texttt{replicate()}. The
argument \texttt{expr} is evaluated \texttt{n} times. In this case we
draw samples of sizes \(n=5\) and \(n=25\), compute the sample means and
repeat this exactly \(n=25000\) times.

For comparison purposes we store results for the estimator \(Y_1\), the
first observation in a sample for a sample of size \(5\), separately.

At first, notice that \emph{all} sampling distributions (represented by
the solid lines) are centered around \(\mu = 10\). This is evidence for
the \emph{unbiasedness} of \(Y_1\), \(\overline{Y}_{n=5}\) and
\(\overline{Y}_{n=25}\). Of course, the theoretical density the
\(N(10,1)\) distribution is centered at \(10\), too.

Next, have a look at the spread of the sampling distributions. Several
things are remarkable:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the sampling distribution of \(Y_1\) (green curve) tracks the density
  of the \(N(10,1)\) distribution (black dashed line) pretty closely In
  fact, the sampling distribution of \(Y_1\) is the \(N(10,1)\)
  distribution. This is less surprising if You keep in mind that the
  \(Y_1\) estimator does nothing but reporting an observation that is
  randomly selected from a population with \(N(10,1)\) distribution.
  Hence, \(Y_1 \sim N(10,1)\). Note that this result does not depend on
  the sample size \(n\): the sampling distribution of \(Y_1\) \emph{is
  always} the population distribution, no matter how large the sample
  is.
\item
  Both sampling distributions of \(\overline{Y}\) show less dispersion
  than the sampling distribution of \(Y_1\). This means that
  \(\overline{Y}\) has a lower variance than \(Y_1\). In view of Key
  Concepts 3.2 and 3.3, we find that \(\overline{Y}\) is a more
  efficient estimator than \(Y_1\). In fact, one can show that this
  holds for all \(n>1\).
\item
  \(\overline{Y}\) shows a behavior that is termed consistency (see Key
  Concept 3.2). Notice that the blue and the red density curves are much
  more concentrated around \(\mu=10\) then the green one. As the number
  of observations is increased from \(1\) to \(5\), the sampling
  distribution tightens around the true parameter. Increasing the sample
  size to \(25\) this effect becomes more dominant. This implies that
  the probability of obtaining estimates that are close to the true
  value increases with \(n\).
\end{itemize}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdknit}
A more precise way to express consitency of an estimator \(\hat\mu\) for
a parameter \(\mu\) is

\[ P(|\hat{\mu} - \mu|<\epsilon) \xrightarrow[n \rightarrow \infty]{p} 1 \quad \text{for any}\quad\epsilon>0.\]

This expression says that the probability of observing a deviation from
the true value \(\mu\) that is smaller than some arbitrary
\(\epsilon > 0\) converges to \(1\) as \(n\) grows. Note that
consistency does not require unbiasedness.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdknit}

We encourage you to go ahead and modify the code. Try out different
values for the sample size and see how the sampling distribution of
\(\overline{Y}\) changes!

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{\(\overline{Y}\) is the Least Squares
Estimator of
\(\mu_Y\)}{\textbackslash{}overline\{Y\} is the Least Squares Estimator of \textbackslash{}mu\_Y}}\label{overliney-is-the-least-squares-estimator-of-mu_y}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{\(\overline{Y}\) is the Least
Squares Estimator of \(\mu_Y\)}

Assume you have some observations \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\) on
\(Y \sim N(10,1)\) (which is unknown) and would like to find an
estimator \(m\) that predicts the observations as good as possible. Good
means to choose \(m\) such that the total deviation between the
predicted value and the observed values is small. Mathematically this
means we want to find an \(m\) that minimizes

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - m)^2. \label{eq:sqm}
\end{equation}

Think of \(Y_i - m\) as the committed mistake when predicting \(Y_i\) by
\(m\). We could just as well minimize the sum of absolute deviations
from \(m\) but minimizing the sum of squared deviations is
mathematically more convenient (and may lead to a different result).
That is why the estimator we are looking for is called the \emph{least
squares estimator}. As It turns out \(m = \overline{Y}\), the estimator
of \(\mu_Y=10\) is this wanted estimator.

We can show this by generating a random sample of fair size and plotting
\eqref{eq:sqm} as a function of \(m\).

Notice that \eqref{eq:sqm} is a quadratic function so there is only one
minimum. The plot shows that this minimum lies exactly at the sample
mean of the sample data.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdknit}
Some R functions can only interact with functions that take a vector as
an input and evaluate the function body on every values of the vector,
for example curve(). We call such functions vectorized functions and it
is often a good idea to write vectorized functions yourself although
this is cumbersome in some cases. Having a vectorized function in R is
never a drawback since these functions work on both single values and
vectors.

Let us look at the function sqm() which is nonvectorized

 sqm \textless{}- function(m) \{\\
\hspace*{0.333em}\hspace*{0.333em}\hspace*{0.333em}\hspace*{0.333em}
sum((y-m)\^{}2) \#body of the function\\
\}

Providing e.g. c(1,2,3) as the argument m would cause an error since
then the operation y-m is invalid: the vecors y and m are of
incompatible dimensions. This is why we cannot use sqm() in conjunction
with curve().

Here comes Vectorize() into play. It generates a vectorized version of a
non-vectorized function.

\subsubsection*{Why Random Sampling is
Important}\label{why-random-sampling-is-important}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Why Random Sampling is Important}

So far, we assumed (sometimes implicitly) that observed data
\(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\) are the result of a sampling process that satisfies
the assumption of i.i.d. random sampling. It is very important that this
assumption is fulfilled when estimating a population mean using
\(\overline{Y}\). If this is not the case, estimates are biased.

Let us fall back to \texttt{pop}, the fictive population of \(10000\)
observations and compute the population mean \(\mu_{\texttt{pop}}\):

\begin{Shaded}

\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(pop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 9.992604
\end{verbatim}

Next we sample \(10\) observations from \texttt{pop} with
\texttt{sample()} and estimate \(\mu_{\texttt{pop}}\) using
\(\overline{Y}\) repeatedly. However this time we use a sampling scheme
that deviates from simple random sampling: instead of ensuring that each
member of the population has the same chance to end up in a sample, we
assign a higher probability of being sampled to the \(2500\) smallest
observations of the population by setting the argument \texttt{prop} to
a suitable vector of probability weights:

We find that in this case failure of the i.i.d. assumption implies that,
on average, we \emph{underestimate} \(\mu_Y\) using \(\overline{Y}\):
the corresponding distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) is shifted to the
left. In other words, \(\overline{Y}\) is a \emph{biased} estimator for
\(\mu_Y\) if the i.i.d. assumption does not hold.

\section{Hypothesis Tests Concerning the Population
Mean}\label{hypothesis-tests-concerning-the-population-mean}

In this section we briefly review concepts in hypothesis testing and
discuss how to conduct hypothesis tests in \texttt{R}. We focus on
drawing inferences about an unknown population mean.

\subsubsection*{About Hypotheses and Hypothesis
Testing}\label{about-hypotheses-and-hypothesis-testing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{About Hypotheses and Hypothesis
Testing}

In a significance test we want to exploit the information contained in a
random sample as evidence in favor or against a hypothesis. Essentially,
hypotheses are simple questions that can be answered by `yes' or `no'.
When conducting a hypothesis test we always deal with two different
hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \emph{null hypothesis}, denoted \(H_0\) is the hypothesis we are
  interested in testing.
\item
  The \emph{alternative hypothesis}, denoted \(H_1\), is the hypothesis
  that holds if the null hypothesis is false.
\end{itemize}

The null hypothesis that the population mean of \(Y\) equals the value
\(\mu_{Y,0}\) is written down as

\[ H_0: E(Y) = \mu_{Y,0}. \]

The alternative hypothesis states what holds if the null hypothesis is
false. Often the alternative hypothesis chosen is the most general one,

\[ H_1: E(Y) \neq \mu_{Y,0}, \]

meaning that \(E(Y)\) may be anything but the value under the null
hypothesis. This is called a \emph{two-sided} alternative.

For the sake of brevity, we will only consider the case of a two-sided
alternative in the subsequent sections of this chapter.

\subsection*{The p-Value}\label{the-p-value}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The p-Value}

Assume that the null hypothesis is \emph{true}. The \(p\)-value is the
probability of drawing data and observing a corresponding test statistic
that is at least as adverse to what is stated under the null hypothesis
as the test statistic actually computed using the sample data.

In the context of the population mean and the sample mean, this
definition can be stated mathematically in the following way:

\begin{equation}
p \text{-value} = P_{H_0}\left[ \lvert \overline{Y} - \mu_{Y,0} \rvert > \lvert \overline{Y}^{act} - \mu_{Y,0} \rvert \right] \label{eq:pvalue}
\end{equation}

In \eqref{eq:pvalue}, \(\overline{Y}^{act}\) is the actually computed mean
of the random sample. Visualized, the \(p\)-value is the area in the
part of tails of the distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) that lies beyond

\[ \mu_{Y,0} \pm \lvert \overline{Y}^{act} - \mu_{Y,0} \rvert. \]

Consequently, in order to compute the \(p\)-value as in \eqref{eq:pvalue},
knowledge about the sampling distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) when the
null hypothesis is true is required. However in most cases the sampling
distribution of \(\overline{Y}\) is unknown. Fortunately, due to the
large-sample normal approximation we know that under the null hypothesis

\[ \overline{Y} \sim N(\mu_{Y,0}, \, \sigma^2_{\overline{Y}}) \ \ , \ \ \sigma^2_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n} \]

and thus

\[ \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_{Y,0}}{\sigma_Y/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1). \]

So in large samples, the \(p\)-value can be computed \emph{without}
knowledge of the exact sampling distribution of \(\overline{Y}\).

\subsection*{Calculating the p-Value When the Standard Deviation Is
Known}\label{calculating-the-p-value-when-the-standard-deviation-is-known}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Calculating the p-Value When the
Standard Deviation Is Known}

For now, let us assume that \(\sigma_{\overline{Y}}\) is known. Then we
can rewrite \eqref{eq:pvalue} as

\begin{align}
p \text{-value} =& \, P_{H_0}\left[ \left\lvert \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_{Y,0}}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}} \right\rvert > \left\lvert \frac{\overline{Y}^{act} - \mu_{Y,0}}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}} \right\rvert \right] \\
=& \, 2 \cdot \Phi \left[ - \left\lvert \frac{\overline{Y}^{act} - \mu_{Y,0}}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}}  \right\rvert\right].  \label{eq:pvaluenorm1}
\end{align}

The \(p\)-value can be seen as the area in the tails of the \(N(0,1)\)
distribution that lies beyond

\begin{equation}
\pm \left\lvert \frac{\overline{Y}^{act} - \mu_{Y,0}}{\sigma_{\overline{Y}}} \right\rvert \label{eq:pvaluenorm2}
\end{equation}

We now use \texttt{R} to visualize what is stated in
\eqref{eq:pvaluenorm1} and \eqref{eq:pvaluenorm2}. The next code chunk

\hypertarget{SVSSDASE}{\subsection*{Sample Variance, Sample Standard
Deviation and Standard Error}\label{SVSSDASE}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sample Variance, Sample Standard
Deviation and Standard Error}

If \(\sigma^2_Y\) is unknown, it must be estimated. This can be done
efficiently using the sample variance

\begin{equation}
s_y^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2.
\end{equation}

Furthermore

\begin{equation}
s_y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2}
\end{equation}

is a suitable estimator for the standard deviation of \(Y\). In R,
\(s_y\) is implemented in the function \texttt{sd()}, use \texttt{?sd}.

Using \texttt{R} we can get a notion that \(s_y\) is a consistent
estimator for \(\sigma_Y\) with

\[ s_Y \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} \sigma_Y. \]

The idea here is to generate a large number of samples \(Y_1,\dots,Y_n\)
where, \(Y\sim N(10,10)\) say, estimate \(\sigma_Y\) using \(s_y\) and
investigate how the distribution of \(s_Y\) changes as \(n\) gets
larger.

The plot shows that the distribution of \(s_Y\) tightens around the true
value \(\sigma_Y = 10\) as \(n\) increases.

The function that estimates the standard deviation of an estimator is
called the \emph{standard error of the estimator}. Key Concept 3.4
summarizes the terminology in the context of the sample mean.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Standard Error of $\overline{Y}$]{3.4}
Take an i.i.d. sample $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$. The mean of $Y$ is consistently estimated by $\overline{Y}$, the sample mean of the $Y_i$. Since $\overline{Y}$ is a random variable, it has a sampling distribution with variance $\frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n}$.

The standard error of $\overline{Y}$, denoted $SE(\overline{Y})$ is an estimator of the standard deviation of $\overline{Y}$:

$$ SE(\overline{Y}) = \hat\sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \frac{s_Y}{\sqrt{n}} $$

The caret (\string^) over $\sigma$ indicates that $\hat\sigma_{\overline{Y}}$ is an estimator for $\sigma_{\overline{Y}}$. 
\end{keyconcepts}

As an example to underpin Key Concept 3.4, consider a sample of
\(n=100\) i.i.d. observations of the Bernoulli distributed variable
\(Y\) with success probability \(p=0.1\) and thus \(E(Y)=p=0.1\) and
\(\text{Var}(Y)=p(1-p)\). \(E(Y)\) can be estimated by \(\overline{Y}\)
which then has variance

\[ \sigma^2_{\overline{Y}} = p(1-p)/n = 0.0009 \]

and standard deviation

\[ \sigma_{\overline{Y}} = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n} = 0.03. \]

In this case the standard error of \(\overline{Y}\) is given by

\[ SE(\overline{Y}) = \sqrt{\overline{Y}(1-\overline{Y})/n}. \]

Let us verify whether \(\overline{Y}\) and \(SE(\overline{Y})\) estimate
the respective true values, on average.

t = \frac{\overline{Y} - \mu_{Y,0}}{SE(\overline{Y})} \label{eq:tstat}
\end{equation}

is called \(t\)-statistic. This \(t\)-statistic plays an important role
in testing hypotheses about \(\mu_Y\). It is a prominent example of a
test statistic.

Implicitly, we already have computed a \(t\)-statistic for
\(\overline{Y}\) in the previous code chunk.

Using \texttt{R}we can show that if \(\mu_{Y,0}\) equals the true value,
that is, if the null hypothesis is true, \eqref{eq:tstat} is approximately

Judging from the plot, the normal approximation works reasonably well
for the chosen sample size. This normal approximation has already been
used in the definition of the \(p\)-value, see \eqref{eq:tstat}.

\subsection*{Hypothesis Testing with a Prespecified Significance
Level}\label{hypothesis-testing-with-a-prespecified-significance-level}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Hypothesis Testing with a Prespecified
Significance Level}

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Terminology of Hypothesis Testing]{3.5}
In hypothesis testing, two types of mistakes are possible:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item The null hypothesis \textit{is} rejected although it is true ($\alpha$-error / type-I-error)  
\item The null hypothesis \textit{is not} rejected although it is false ($\beta$-error / type-II-error) 
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

The \textit{significance level} of the test is the probability to commit a type-I-error we are willing to accept in advance. E.g. using a prespecified significance level of $0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis if and only if the $p$-value is less than $0.05$. The significance level is chosen before the test is conducted.\newline

An equivalent procedure is to reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic observed is, in absolute value terms, larger than the \textit{critical value} of the test statistic. The critical value is determined by the significance level chosen and defines two disjoint sets of values which are called \textit{acceptance region} and \textit{rejection region}. The acceptance region contains all values of the test statistic for which the test does not reject while the rejection region contains all the values for which the test does reject.\newline

The \textit{$p$-value} is the probability that, in repeated sampling under the same conditions, a test statistic is observed that provides just as much evidence against the null hypothesis as the test statistic actually observed.\newline

The actual probability that the test rejects the true null hypothesis is called the \textit{size of the test}. In an ideal setting, the size does not exceed the significance level.\newline

The probability that the test correctly rejects a false null hypothesis is called \textit{power}. 
\end{keyconcepts}

Reconsider \texttt{pvalue} computed further above:

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{pvalue }\OperatorTok{<}\StringTok{ }\FloatTok{0.05}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] FALSE
\end{verbatim}

The condition is not fulfilled so we do not reject the null hypothesis
(remember that the null hypothesis is true in this example).

When working with a \(t\)-statistic instead, it is equivalent to apply
the following rule:

\[ \text{Reject } H_0 \text{ if } \lvert t^{act} \rvert > 1.96 \]

We reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of \(5\%\) if
the computed \(t\)-statistic lies beyond the critical value of 1.96 in
absolute value terms. \(1.96\) is the \(0.05\)-quantile of the standard
normal distribution.

Just like using the \(p\)-value, we cannot reject the null hypothesis
using the corresponding \(t\)-statistic. Key Concept 3.6 summarizes the
procedure of performing a two-sided hypothesis about the population mean
\(E(Y)\).

\begin{keyconcepts}[Testing the Hypothesis $E(Y) = \mu_{Y,0}$ Against the Alternative $E(Y) \neq \mu_{Y,0}$]{3.6}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate $\mu_{Y}$ using $\overline{Y}$ and compute $SE(\overline{Y})$, the standard error of $SE(\overline{Y})$.
\item Compute the $t$-statistic.
\item Compute the $p$-value and reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level of significance if the $p$-value is smaller than $0.05$ or, equivalently, if $$\left\lvert t^{act} \right\rvert > 1.96.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{One-sided Alternatives}\label{one-sided-alternatives}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{One-sided Alternatives}

Sometimes we are interested in finding evidence that the mean is bigger
or smaller than some value hypothesized under the null. One can come up
with many examples here but, to stick to the book, take the presumed
wage gap between well and less educated working individuals. Since we
hope that this differential exists, a relevant alternative (to the null
hypothesis that there is no wage differential) is that good educated
individuals earn more, i.e.~that the average hourly wage for this group,
\(\mu_Y\) is \emph{bigger} than \(\mu_{Y,0}\) the know average wage of
less educated workers.

This is an example of a \emph{right-sided test} and the hypotheses pair
is chosen to be

\[ H_0: \mu_Y = \mu_{Y,0} \ \ \text{vs} \ \ H_1: \mu_Y > \mu_{Y,0}. \]

We reject the null hypothesis if the computed test-statistic is larger
than the critical value \(1.64\), the \(0.95\)-quantile of the
\(N(0,1)\) distribution. This ensures that \(1-0.95=5\%\) probability
mass remains in the area to the right of the critical value. Similar as
before we can visualize this in \texttt{R} using the function
\texttt{polygon()}.

Analogously for the left-sided test we have
\[H_0: \mu_Y = \mu_{Y,0} \ \ \text{vs.} \ \ H_1: \mu_Y < \mu_{Y,0}.\]
The null is rejected if the observed test statistic falls short of the
critical value which, for a test at the \(0.05\) level of significance,
is given by \(-1.64\), the \(0.05\)-quantile of the \(N(0,1)\)
distribution. \(5\%\) probability mass lies to the left of the critical
value.

It is straightforward to adapt the code chunk above to the case of a
left-sided test. We only have to adjust the color shading and the tick
marks.

\section{Confidence Intervals for the Population
Mean}\label{confidence-intervals-for-the-population-mean}

As stressed before, we will never estimate the \emph{exact} value of the
population mean of \(Y\) using a random sample. However, we can compute
confidence intervals for the population mean. In general, a confidence
interval for a unknown parameter is a set of values that contains the
true parameter with a prespecified probability, the \emph{confidence
level}. Confidence intervals are computed using the information
available in the sample. Since this information is the result of a
random process, confidence intervals are random variables themselves.

Key Concept 3.7 shows how to compute confidence intervals for the
unknown population mean \(E(Y)\).

\begin{keyconcepts}[Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean]{3.7}
A $95\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_Y$ is a \texttt{random variable} that contains the true $\mu_Y$ in $95\%$ of all possible random samples. When $n$ is large we can use the normal approximation. Then, $99\%$, $95\%$, $90\%$ confidence intervals are

\begin{align}
&99\%\text{ confidence interval for } \mu_Y = \left[ \overline{Y} \pm 2.58 \times SE(\overline{Y}) \right], \\
&95\%\text{ confidence interval for } \mu_Y = \left[\overline{Y} \pm 1.96 \times SE(\overline{Y}) \right], \\
&90\%\text{ confidence interval for } \mu_Y = \left[ \overline{Y} \pm 1.64 \times SE(\overline{Y}) \right].
\end{align}

These confidence intervals are sets of null hypotheses we cannot reject in a two-sided hypothesis test at the given level of confidence.\newline

Now consider the following statements.\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item The interval
$$ \left[ \overline{Y} \pm 1.96 \times SE(\overline{Y}) \right] $$
covers the true value of $\mu_Y$ with a probability of $95\%$.

\item We have computed $\overline{Y} = 5.1$ and $SE(\overline{Y})=2.5$ so the interval
$$ \left[5.1  \pm 1.96 \times 2.5 \right] = \left[0.2,10\right] $$ covers the true value of $\mu_Y$ with a probability of $95\%$.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

While 1. is right (this is exactly in line with the definition above), 2. is completely wrong and none of your lecturers wants to read such a sentence in a term paper, written exam or similar, believe us.
The difference is that, while 1. is the definition of a random variable, 2. is one possible \textit{outcome} of this random variable so there is no meaning in making any probabilistic statement about it. Either the computed interval    extit{does cover} $\mu_Y$ or it \textit{does not}!
\end{keyconcepts}

In \texttt{R}, testing of hypotheses about the mean of a population on
the basis of a random sample is very easy due to functions like
\texttt{t.test()} from the \texttt{stats} package. It produces an object
of type \texttt{list}. Luckily, one of the most simple ways to use
\texttt{t.test()} is when you want to obtain a \(95\%\) confidence
interval for some population mean. We start by generating some random
data and calling \texttt{t.test()} in conjunction with \texttt{ls()} to
obtain a breakdown of the output components.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# set random seed}

\CommentTok{# generate some sample data}
\NormalTok{sampledata <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# checke type}
\KeywordTok{typeof}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(sampledata))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "alternative" "conf.int"    "data.name"   "estimate"    "method"     
## [6] "null.value"  "p.value"     "parameter"   "statistic"
\end{verbatim}

Though we find that many items are reported, at the moment we are only
interested in computing a \(95\%\) confidence set for the mean.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(sampledata)}\OperatorTok{$}\StringTok{"conf.int"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1]  9.306651 12.871096
## attr(,"conf.level")
## [1] 0.95
\end{verbatim}

This tells us that the \(95\%\) confidence interval is

\[ \left[9.31, 12.87\right]. \]

In this example, the computed interval obviously does cover the true
\(\mu_Y\) which we know to be \(10\).

Let us have a look at the whole standard output produced by
\texttt{t.test()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{t.test}\NormalTok{(sampledata)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  sampledata
## t = 12.346, df = 99, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##   9.306651 12.871096
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  11.08887
\end{verbatim}

We see that \texttt{t.test()} does not only compute a \(95\%\)
confidence interval but automatically conducts a two-sided significance
test of the hypothesis \(H_0: \mu_Y = 0\) at the level of \(5\%\) and
reports relevant parameters thereof: the alternative hypothesis, the
estimated mean, the resulting \(t\)-statistic, the degrees of freedom of
the underlying \(t\) distribution (\texttt{t.test()} does not perform
the normal approximation) and the corresponding \(p\)-value. This is
very convenient!

In this example, we come to the conclusion that the population mean
\emph{is not} significantly different from \(0\) (which is correct) at
the level of \(5\%\), since \(\mu_Y = 0\) is element of the \(95\%\)
confidence interval

\[ 0 \in \left[-0.27,0.12\right]. \] We come to an equivalent result
when using the \(p\)-value rejection rule since

\[ p = 0.456 > 0.05. \]

\section{Comparing Means from Different
Populations}\label{comparing-means-from-different-populations}

Suppose you are interested in the means of two different populations,
denote them \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\). More specifically you are
interested whether these population means are different from each other
and plan using a hypothesis test to verify this on the basis of
independent sample data from both populations. A suitable pair of
hypotheses is

\begin{equation}
H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = d_0 \ \ \text{vs.} \ \ H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq d_0 \label{eq:hypmeans}
\end{equation}

where \(d_0\) denotes the hypothesized difference in means. The book
teaches us that \(H_0\) can be tested with the \(t\)-statistic

\begin{equation}
t=\frac{(\overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_2) - d_0}{SE(\overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_2)} \label{eq:tstatmeans}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
SE(\overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}.
\end{equation}

This is called a two sample \(t\)-test. For large \(n_1\) and \(n_2\),
\eqref{eq:tstatmeans} is standard normal distributed under the null
hypothesis. Analogously to the simple \(t\)-test we can compute
confidence intervals for the true difference in population means:

\[ (\overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_2) \pm 1.96 \times SE(\overline{Y}_1 - \overline{Y}_2) \]

is a \(95\%\) confidence interval for \(d\). In \texttt{R}, hypotheses
as in \eqref{eq:hypmeans} can be tested with \texttt{t.test()}, too. Note
that \texttt{t.test()} chooses \(d_0 = 0\) by default. This can be
changed by setting the argument \texttt{mu} accordingly.

The subsequent code chunk demonstrates how to perform a two sample
\(t\)-test in \texttt{R} using simulated data.

## sample estimates:

## 11.088874  9.243838
\end{verbatim}

We find that the two sample \(t\)-test does not reject the (true) null
hypothesis that \(d_0 = 0\).

This section discusses how to reproduce the results presented in the box
\emph{The Gender Gap of Earnings of College Graduates in the United
States} of the book.

In order to reproduce Table 3.1 of the book you need to download the
replication data which are hosted by Pearson and can be downloaded
\href{http://wps.aw.com/aw_stock_ie_3/178/45691/11696965.cw/index.html}{here}.
Download the data for Chapter 3 as an excel spreadsheet
(\texttt{cps\_ch3.xlsx}). This data set contains data that range from
\(1992\) to \(2008\) and earnings are reported in prices of \(2008\).
There are several ways to import the \texttt{.xlsx}-files into
\texttt{R}. Our suggestion is the function \texttt{read\_excel()} from
the \texttt{readxl} package \citep{R-readxl}. The package is not part of
\texttt{R}'s base version and has to be installed manually.

You are now ready to import the data set. Make sure you use the correct
path to import the downloaded file! In our example, the file is saved in
a sub folder (\texttt{data}) of the working directory. If you are not
sure what your current working directory is, use \texttt{getwd()}, see
also \texttt{?getwd()}. This will give you the path that points to the

With the pipe operator \texttt{\%>\%} we simply chain different
\texttt{R} functions that produce compatible input and output. In the
code above, we take the data set \texttt{cps} and use it as an input for
the function \texttt{group\_by()}. The output of \texttt{group\_by} is
subsequently used as an input for \texttt{summarise()} and so forth.

Now that we have computed the statistics of interest for both genders,
we can investigate how the gap in earnings between both groups evolves
over time.

We observe virtually the same results as the ones presented in the book.
The computed statistics suggest that there \emph{is} a gender gap in
earnings. Note that we can reject the null hypothesis that the gap is
zero for all periods. Further, estimates of the gap and limits of the
\(95\%\) confidence intervals indicate that the gap has been quite
stable over the recent past.

\section{Scatterplots, Sample Covariance and Sample
Correlation}\label{scatterplots-sample-covariance-and-sample-correlation}

A scatter plot represents two dimensional data, for example \(n\)
observation on \(X_i\) and \(Y_i\), by points in a Cartesian coordinate
system. It is very easy to generate scatter plots using the
\texttt{plot()} function in \texttt{R}. Let us generate some fictional
data on age and earnings of workers and plot it.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-123-1} \end{center}

The plot shows positive correlation between age and earnings. This is in
line with the assumption that older workers earn more than those who
joined the working population recently.

\subsubsection*{Sample Covariance and
Correlation}\label{sample-covariance-and-correlation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Sample Covariance and Correlation}

By now you should be familiar with the concepts of variance and
covariance. If not, we recommend you to work your way through Chapter 2
of the book.

Just like the variance, covariance and correlation of two variables are
properties that relate to the (unknown) joint probability distribution
of these variables. We can estimate covariance and correlation by means
of suitable estimators using a random sample \((X_i,Y_i)\),
\(i=1,\dots,n\).

The sample covariance

\[ s_{XY} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})(Y_i - \overline{Y}) \]

is an estimator for the population variance of \(X\) and \(Y\) whereas
the sample correlation

\[ r_{XY} = \frac{s_{XY}}{s_Xs_Y} \] can be used to estimate the
population correlation, a standardized measure for the strength of the
linear relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\). See Chapter 3.7 in the book
for a more detailed treatment of these estimators.

As for variance and standard deviation, these estimators are implemented
as \texttt{R} functions in the \texttt{stats} package. We can use them
to estimate population covariance and population correlation of the
fictional data on age and earnings.

The estimates indicate that \(X\) and \(Y\) are moderately correlated.

\chapter{Linear Regression with One Regressor}\label{lrwor}

This chapter introduces the basics in linear regression and shows how to
perform regression analysis in \texttt{R}. In linear regression, the aim
is to model the relationship between a dependent variable \(Y\) and one
or more explanatory variables denoted by \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k\).
Following the book we will focus on the concept of simple linear
regression throughout the whole chapter. In simple linear regression,
there is just one explanatory variable \(X_1\). If for example a school
cuts its class sizes by hiring new teachers, that is, the school lowers
\(X_1\), the student-teacher ratios of their classes, how would this
affect \(Y\), the performance of the students involved in a standardized
test? With linear regression we can not only examine whether the
student-teacher ratio \emph{does have} an impact on the test results but
we can also learn about the \emph{direction} and the \emph{strength} of
this effect.

The following packages are needed for reproducing the code presented in
this chapter:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{AER} - accompanies the Book \emph{Applied Econometrics with R}
  \citet{kleiber2008} and provides useful functions and data sets.
\item
  \texttt{MASS} - a collection of functions for applied statistics.
\end{itemize}

Make sure these are installed before you go ahead and try to replicate
the examples. The savest way to do so is by checking whether the
following code chunk executes without any errors.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\section{Simple Linear Regression}\label{simple-linear-regression}

To start with an easy example, consider the following combinations of
average test score and the average student-teacher ratio in some
fictional school districts.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrr}
\toprule
  & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\
\midrule
TestScore & 680 & 640 & 670 & 660 & 630 & 660.0 & 635\\
STR & 15 & 17 & 19 & 20 & 22 & 23.5 & 25\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To work with these data in \texttt{R} we begin by generating two
vectors: one for the student-teacher ratios (\texttt{STR}) and one for
test scores (\texttt{TestScore}), both containing the data from the
table above.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

If we use a simple linear regression model, we model the true
relationship between both variables by a straight line, formally

\[ Y = b \cdot X + a. \]

For now, let us suppose that the true function which relates test score
and student-teacher ratio to each other is

\[TestScore = 713 - 3 \times STR.\]

It is always a good idea to visualize the data you work with. For our
purpose it is suitable to use the function \texttt{plot()} to produce a
scatter plot with \texttt{STR} on the \(X\)-axis and \texttt{TestScore}
on the \(Y\)-axis. An easy way to do so is to call
\texttt{plot(y\_variable\ \textasciitilde{}\ x\_variable)} whereby
\texttt{y\_variable} and \texttt{x\_variable} are placeholders for the
vectors of observations we want to plot. Furthermore, we might want to
add the true relationship to the plot. To draw a straight line,
\texttt{R} provides the function \texttt{abline()}. We just have to call
this function with arguments \texttt{a} (representing the intercept) and
\texttt{b} (representing the slope) after executing \texttt{plot()} in
order to add the line to our scatter plot.

The following code reproduces Figure 4.1 from the textbook.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# create a scatter plot of the data}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-139-1} \end{center}

We find that the line does not touch any of the points although we
claimed that it represents the true relationship. The reason for this is
the core problem of statistics, \emph{randomness}. Most of the time
there are influences which cannot be explained in a purely deterministic
fashion and thus complicate finding the true relationship.

In order to account for these differences between observed data and the
true relationship, we extend our model from above by an \emph{error
term} \(u\) which covers these random effects. Put differently, \(u\)
accounts for all the differences between the true regression line and
the actual observed data. Beside pure randomness, these deviations could
also arise from measurement errors or, as will be discussed later, could
be the consequence of leaving out other factors that are relevant in
explaining the dependent variable. Which other factors are plausible in
our example? For one thing, the test scores might be driven by the
teachers quality and the background of the students. It is also
imaginable that in some classes, the students were lucky on the test
days and thus achieved higher scores. For now, we will summarize such
influences by an additive component:

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \text{other factors} \]

Of course this idea is very general as it can be easily extended to
other situations that can be described with a linear model. The basic
linear regression function we will work with hence is

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i. \]

Key Concept 4.1 summarizes the terminology of the simple linear
regression model.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Terminology for the Linear Regression Model with a Single Regressor]{4.1}
The linear regression model is $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + u_i$$
where
\begin{itemize}
\item the index $i$ runs over the observations, $i=1,\dots,n$
\item $Y_i$ is the \textit{dependent variable}, the \textit{regressand}, or simply the \textit{left-hand variable}
\item $X_i$ is the \textit{independent variable}, the \textit{regressor}, or simply the \textit{right-hand variable}
\item $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ is the \textit{population regression line} also called the \textit{population regression function}
\item $\beta_0$ is the \textit{intercept} of the population regression line
\item $\beta_1$ is the \textit{slope} of the population regression line
\item $u_i$ is the \textit{error term}.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

\section{Estimating the Coefficients of the Linear Regression
Model}\label{estimating-the-coefficients-of-the-linear-regression-model}

In practice, the intercept \(\beta_0\) and slope \(\beta_1\) of the
population regression line are unknown. Therefore, we must employ data
to estimate both unknown parameters. In the following a real world
example will be used to demonstrate how this is achieved. We want to
relate test scores to student-teacher ratios measured in Californian
schools. The test score is the district-wide average of reading and math
scores for fifth graders. Again, the class size is measured as the
number of students divided by the number of teachers (the
student-teacher ratio). As for the data, the California School data set
(\texttt{CASchools}) comes with an \texttt{R} package called
\texttt{AER}, an acronym for
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/AER.pdf}{Applied
Econometrics with R} \citep{R-AER}. After installing the package with
\texttt{install.packages("AER")} and attaching it with
\texttt{library("AER")} the data set can be loaded using the
\texttt{data()} function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# install the AER package (once)}

\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(AER)   }

\CommentTok{# load the the data set in the workspace}
\KeywordTok{data}\NormalTok{(CASchools) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once a package has been installed it is available for use at further
occasions when invoked with \texttt{library()} --- there is no need to
run \texttt{install.packages()} again!

It is interesting to know what kind of object we are dealing with.
\texttt{class()} returns the class of an object. Depending on the class
of an object some functions (for example \texttt{plot()} and
\texttt{summary()}) behave differently.

Let us check the class of the object \texttt{CASchools}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{(CASchools)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "data.frame"
\end{verbatim}

It turns out that \texttt{CASchools} is of class \texttt{data.frame}
which is a convenient format to work with, especially for performing
regression analysis.

With help of \texttt{head()} we get a first overview of our data. This
function shows only the first 6 rows of the data set which prevents an
overcrowded console output.

We find that the data set consists of plenty of variables and most of
them are numeric.

By the way: an alternative to \texttt{class()} and \texttt{head()} is
\texttt{str()} which is deduced from `structure' and gives a
comprehensive overview of the object. Try!

Turning back to \texttt{CASchools}, the two variables we are interested
in (i.e.~average test score and the student-teacher ratio) are
\emph{not} included. However, it is possible to calculate both from the
provided data. To obtain the student-teacher ratios, we simply divide
the number of students by the number of teachers. The average test score
is the arithmetic mean of the test score for reading and the score of
the math test. The next code chunk shows how the two variables can be
constructed as vectors and how they are appended to \texttt{CASchools}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we ran \texttt{head(CASchools)} again we would find the two variables
of interest as additional columns named \texttt{STR} and \texttt{score}.
(check this!)

Table 4.1 from the text book summarizes the distribution of test scores
and student-teacher ratios. There are several functions which can be
used to produce similar results, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{mean()} (computes the arithmetic mean of the provided numbers)
\item
  \texttt{sd()} (computes the sample standard deviation)
\item
  \texttt{quantile()} (returns a vector of the specified sample
  quantiles for the data).
\end{itemize}

The next code chunk shows how to achieve this. First, we compute summary
statistics on the columns \texttt{STR} and \texttt{score} of
\texttt{CASchools}. In order to have a nice display format we gather the
computed measures in a \texttt{data.frame} named
\texttt{DistributionSummary}.

As for the sample data, we use \texttt{plot()} for a visual survey. This
allows us to detect specific characteristics of our data, such as
outliers which are hard to discover by looking at mere numbers. This
time we add some additional arguments to the call of \texttt{plot()}.

The first argument in our call of \texttt{plot()},
\texttt{score \textasciitilde{} STR}, is again a formula that states the
dependent variable and the regressor. However, this time the two
variables are not saved in separate vectors but are columns of
\texttt{CASchools}. Therefore, \texttt{R} would not find them without
the argument \texttt{data} being correctly specified. \texttt{data} must
be in accordance with the name of the \texttt{data.frame} to which the
variables belong to, in this case \texttt{CASchools}. Further arguments
are used to change the appearance of the plot: while \texttt{main} adds
a title, \texttt{xlab} and \texttt{ylab} add custom labels to both axes.

The plot (figure 4.2 in the book) shows the scatter plot of all
observations on student-teacher ratio and Test score. We see that the
points are strongly scattered and an apparent relationship cannot be
detected by only looking at them. Yet it can be assumed that both
variables are negatively correlated, that is, we expect to observe lower
test scores in bigger classes.

The function \texttt{cor()} (type and execute \texttt{?cor} for further
info) can be used to compute the correlation between two \emph{numeric}
vectors.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

As the scatter plot already suggests, the correlation is negative but
rather weak.

The task we are facing now is to find a line which fits best to the
data. Of course we could simply stick with graphical inspection and
correlation analysis and then select the best fitting line by
eyeballing. However, this is pretty unscientific and prone to subjective
perception: different students would draw different regression lines. On
this account, we are interested in techniques that are more
sophisticated. Such a technique is ordinary least squares (OLS)
estimation.

\subsection*{The Ordinary Least Squares
Estimator}\label{the-ordinary-least-squares-estimator}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Ordinary Least Squares Estimator}

The OLS estimator chooses the regression coefficients such that the
estimated regression line is as close as possible to the observed data
points. Therefore closeness is measured by the sum of the squared
mistakes made in predicting \(Y\) given \(X\). Let \(b_0\) and \(b_1\)
be some estimators of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\). Then the sum of
squared estimation mistakes can be expressed as

\[ \sum^n_{i = 1} (Y_i - b_0 - b_1 X_i)^2. \]

The OLS estimator in the simple regression model is the pair of
estimators for intercept and slope which minimizes the expression above.
The derivation of the OLS estimators for both parameters are presented
in Appendix 4.1 of the book. The results are summarized in Key Concept
4.2.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The OLS Estimator, Predicted Values, and Residuals]{4.2}
The OLS estimators of the slope $\beta_1$ and the intercept $\beta_0$ in the simple linear regression model are
\begin{align*}
  \hat\beta_1 & = \frac{ \sum_{i = 1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})(Y_i - \overline{Y}) } { \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2},  \\
\hat\beta_0 & =  \overline{Y} - \hat\beta_1 \overline{X}. 
\intertext{The OLS predicted values $\widehat{Y}_i$ and residuals $\hat{u}_i$ are}
  \widehat{Y}_i & =  \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_i,\\
  \hat{u}_i & =  Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i. 
\end{align*}

The estimated intercept $\hat{\beta}_0$, the slope parameter $\hat{\beta}_1$ and the residuals $\left(\hat{u}_i\right)$ are computed from a sample of $n$ observations of $X_i$ and $Y_i$, $i$, $...$,  $n$. These are \textit{estimates} of the unknown true population intercept $\left(\beta_0 \right)$, slope $\left(\beta_1\right)$, and error term $(u_i)$.
\end{keyconcepts}

The formulas presented above may not be very intuitive at first glance.
The following interactive application aims to help you understand the
mechanics of OLS. You can add observations by clicking into the
coordinate system where the data are represented by points. If two or
more observations are available, the application computes a regression
line using OLS and some statistics which are displayed in the right
panel. The results are updated as you add further observations to the
left panel. A double-click resets the application i.e.~all data are
removed.

There are many possible ways to compute \(\hat{\beta_0}\) and
\(\hat{\beta_1}\) in \texttt{R}. For example, we could implement the
formulas presented in Key Concept 4.2 with two of \texttt{R}'s most
basic functions: \texttt{mean()} and \texttt{sum()}.

Of course there are also other and even more manual ways to do the same
tasks. Luckily, OLS is one of the most widely-used estimation
techniques. Being a statistical programming language, R already contains
a built-in function named \texttt{lm()} (\textbf{l}inear \textbf{m}odel)
which can be used to carry out regression analysis.

The first argument of the function to be specified is, similar to
\texttt{plot()}, the regression formula with the basic syntax
\texttt{y \textasciitilde{} x} where \texttt{y} is the dependent
variable and \texttt{x} the explanatory variable. The argument
\texttt{data} determines the data set to be used in the regression. We
now revisit the example from the book where the relationship between the
test scores and the class sizes is analysed. The following code uses
\texttt{lm()} to replicate the results presented in figure 4.3 of the
book.

Let us add the estimated regression line to the plot. This time we also
enlarge ranges of both axes by setting the arguments \texttt{xlim} and
\texttt{ylim}.

Did you notice that this time, we did not pass the intercept and slope
parameters to \texttt{abline}? If you call \texttt{abline()} on an
object of class \texttt{lm} that only contains a single regressor,
\texttt{R} draws the regression line automatically!

\section{Measures of Fit}\label{measures-of-fit}

After estimating a linear regression model, the question occurs how well
the model describes the data. Visually this amounts to assess whether
the observations are tightly clustered around the regression line, or if
they are spread out. Both, the \emph{coefficient of determination} and
the \emph{standard error of the regression} measure how well the OLS
Regression line fits the data.

\subsection*{The Coefficient of
Determination}\label{the-coefficient-of-determination}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Coefficient of Determination}

\(R^2\), the \emph{coefficient of determination}, is the fraction of thr
sample variance of \(Y_i\) that is explained by \(X_i\). Mathematically,
the \(R^2\) can be written as the ratio of the explained sum of squares
to the total sum of squares. The \emph{explained sum of squares}
(\(ESS\)) is the sum of squared deviations of the predicted values
\(\hat{Y_i}\), from the average of the \(Y_i\). The \emph{total sum of
squares} (\(TSS\)) is the sum of squared deviations of the \(Y_i\) from
their average. Thus we have

\begin{align}
  ESS & =  \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \hat{Y_i} - \overline{Y} \right)^2,   \\
  \\
  TSS & =  \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( Y_i - \overline{Y} \right)^2,   \\
  \\
  R^2 & = \frac{ESS}{TSS}.
\end{align}

Since \(TSS = ESS + SSR\) we can also write

\[ R^2 = 1- \frac{SSR}{TSS} \]

where \(SSR\) is the sum of squared residuals, a measure for the errors
made when predicting the \(Y\) by \(X\). The \(SSR\) is defined as

\[ SSR = \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{u}_i^2. \]

\(R^2\) lies between \(0\) and \(1\). It is easy to see that a perfect
fit, i.e.~no errors made when fitting the regression line, implies
\(R^2 = 1\) since then we have \(SSR=0\). On the contrary, if our
estimated regression line does not explain any variation in the \(Y_i\),
we have \(ESS=0\) and consequently \(R^2=0\).

\subsection*{The Standard Error of the
Regression}\label{the-standard-error-of-the-regression}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Standard Error of the Regression}

The \emph{Standard Error of the Regression} (\(SER\)) is an estimator of
the standard deviation of the regression error \(\hat{u}_i\). As such it
measures the magnitude of a typical deviation from the regression line,
i.e.~the magnitude of a typical regression error.

\[ SER = s_{\hat{u}} = \sqrt{s_{\hat{u}}^2} \ \ \ \text{where} \ \ \ s_{\hat{u} }^2 = \frac{1}{n-2} \sum_{i = 1}^n \hat{u}^2_i = \frac{SSR}{n - 2} \]

Remember that the \(u_i\) are \emph{unobserved}. This is why we use
their estimated counterparts, the residuals \(\hat{u}_i\) instead. See
Chapter 4.3 of the book for a more detailed comment on the \(SER\).

\subsection*{Application to the Test Score
Data}\label{application-to-the-test-score-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Application to the Test Score Data}

Both measures of fit can be obtained by using the function
\texttt{summary()} with an \texttt{lm} object provided as the only
argument. While the function \texttt{lm()} only prints out the estimated
coefficients to the console, \texttt{summary()} provides additional
predefined information such as the regression's \(R^2\) and the \(SER\).

\end{verbatim}

The \(R^2\) in the output is called \emph{Multiple R-squared} and has a
value of \(0.051\). Hence, \(5.1 \%\) of the variance of the dependent
variable \(score\) is explained by the explanatory variable \(STR\).
That is the regression explains little of the variance in \(score\) much
of the variation in test scores remains unexplained (cf.~Figure 4.3 of
the book).

The \(SER\) is called \emph{Residual standard error} and takes the value
\(18.58\). The unit of the \(SER\) is the same as the unit of the
dependent variable. In our context we can interpret the value as
follows: on average the deviation of the actual achieved test score and
the regression line is \(18.58\) points.

Now, let us check whether \texttt{summary()} uses the same definitions
for \(R^2\) and \(SER\) as we do by computing them manually.

\section{The Least Squares Assumptions}\label{tlsa}

OLS performs well under a quite broad variety of different
circumstances. However, there are some assumptions which are posed on
the data which need to be satisfied in order to achieve reliable
results.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Least Squares Assumptions]{4.3}
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i \text{, } i = 1,\dots,n$$
where

\begin{enumerate}
\item The error term $u_i$ has conditional mean zero given $X_i$: $E(u_i|X_i) = 0$.
\item $(X_i,Y_i), i = 1,\dots,n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from their joint distribution.
\item Large outliers are unlikely: $X_i$ and $Y_i$ have nonzero finite fourth moments.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{Assumption 1: The Error Term has Conditional Mean of
Zero}\label{assumption-1-the-error-term-has-conditional-mean-of-zero}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Assumption 1: The Error Term has
Conditional Mean of Zero}

This means that no matter which value we choose for \(X\), the error
term \(u\) must not show any systematic pattern and must have a mean of
\(0\). Consider the case that \(E(u) = 0\) but for low and high values
of \(X\), the error term tends to be positive and for midrange values of
\(X\) the error tends to be negative. We can use R to construct such an
example. To do so we generate our own data using R's build in random
number generators.

We will use the following functions you should be familiar with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{runif()} (generates uniformly distributed random numbers)
\item
  \texttt{rnorm()} (generates normally distributed random numbers)
\item
  \texttt{predict()} (does predictions based on the results of model
  fitting functions like \texttt{lm()})
\item
  \texttt{lines()} (adds line segments to an existing plot)
\end{itemize}

We start by creating a vector containing values that are randomly
scattered on the interval \([-5,5]\). For our example we decide to
generate uniformly distributed random numbers. This can be done with the
function \texttt{runif()}. We also need to simulate the error term. For
this we generate normally distributed random numbers with a mean equal
to \(0\) and a variance of \(1\) using \texttt{rnorm()}. The \(Y\)
values are obtained as a quadratic function of the \(X\) values and the
error. After generating the data we estimate both a simple regression
model and a quadratic model that also includes the regressor \(X^2\).
Finally, we plot the simulated data and add a the estimated regression
line of a simple regression model as well as the predictions made with a
quadratic model to compare the fit graphically.

The plot shows what is meant by \(E(u_i|X_i) = 0\) and why it does not
hold for the linear model:

Using the quadratic model (represented by the black curve) we see that
there are no systematic deviations of the observation from the predicted
relation. It is credible that the assumption is not violated when such a
model is employed. However, using a simple linear regression model we
see that the assumption is probably violated as \(E(u_i|X_i)\) varies
with the \(X_i\).

\subsection*{Assumption 2: Independently and Identically Distributed
Data}\label{assumption-2-independently-and-identically-distributed-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Assumption 2: Independently and
Identically Distributed Data}

Most sampling schemes used when collecting data from populations produce
i.i.d. samples. For example, we could use \texttt{R}'s random number
generator to randomly select student IDs from a university's enrollment
list and record age \(X\) and earnings \(Y\) of the corresponding
students. This is a typical example of simple random sampling and
ensures that all the \((X_i, Y_i)\) are drawn randomly from the same
population.

A prominent example where the i.i.d. assumption is not fulfilled is time
series data where we have observations on the same unit over time. For
example, take \(X\) as the number of workers employed by a production
company over the course of time. Due to technological change, the
company makes job cuts periodically but there are also some
non-deterministic influences that relate to economics, politics and
alike. Using \texttt{R} we can easily simulate such a process and plot
it.

We start the series with a total of 5000 workers and simulate the
reduction of employment with a simple autoregressive process that
exhibits a downward trend and has normally distributed errors:\footnote{See
  Chapter 14 of the book for more on autoregressive processes and time
  series analysis in general.}

\[ employment_t = 0.98 \cdot employment_{t-1} + u_t \]

It is evident that the observations on the number of employees cannot be
independent in this example: the level of today's employment is
correlated with tomorrows employment level. Thus, the i.i.d. assumption
is violated.

\subsection*{Assumption 3: Large Outliers are
Unlikely}\label{assumption-3-large-outliers-are-unlikely}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Assumption 3: Large Outliers are
Unlikely}

It is easy to come up with situations where extreme observations,
i.e.~observations that deviate considerably from the usual range of the
data, may occur. Such observations are called outliers. Technically
speaking, assumption 3 requires that \(X\) and \(Y\) have a finite
kurtosis.\footnote{See Chapter 4.4 of the book.}

Common cases where we want to exclude or (if possible) correct such
outliers is when they are apparently typos, conversion errors or
measurement errors. Even if it seems like extreme observations have been
recorded correctly, it is advisable to exclude them before estimating a
model since OLS suffers from \emph{sensitivity to outliers}.

What does this mean? One can show that extreme observations receive
heavy weighting in the estimation of the unknown regression coefficients
when using OLS. Therefore, outliers can lead to strongly distorted
estimates of regression coefficients. To get a better impression of this
issue, consider the following application where we have placed some
sample data on \(X\) and \(Y\) which are highly correlated. The relation
between \(X\) and \(Y\) seems to be explained pretty good by the plotted
regression line: all of the blue dots lie close to the red line and we
have \(R^2=0.92\).

Now go ahead and add a further observation at, say, \((18,2)\). This
observations clearly is an outlier. The result is quite striking: the
estimated regression line differs greatly from the one we adjudged to
fit the data well. The slope is heavily downward biased and \(R^2\)
decreased to a mere \(29\%\)! Double-click inside the coordinate system
to reset the app. Feel free to experiment. Choose different coordinates
for the outlier or add additional ones.

The following code roughly reproduces what is shown in figure 4.5 in the
book. As done above we use sample data generated using \texttt{R}'s
random number functions \texttt{rnorm()} and \texttt{runif()}. We
estimate two simple regression models, one based on the original data
set and another using a modified set where one observation is change to
be an outlier and then plot the results. In order to understand the
complete code you should be familiar with the function \texttt{sort()}
which sorts the entries of a numeric vector in ascending order.

\hypertarget{tsdotoe}{\section{The Sampling Distribution of the OLS
Estimator}\label{tsdotoe}}

Because \(\hat{\beta_0}\) and \(\hat{\beta_1}\) are computed from a
randomly drawn sample, the estimators themselves are random variables
with a probability distribution --- the so-called sampling distribution
of the estimators --- which describes the values they could take on over
different random samples. Although the sampling distribution of
\(\hat{\beta_0}\) and \(\hat{\beta_1}\) can be complicated when the
sample size is small and generally differs with the number of
observation, \(n\), it is possible to make certain statements about it
that hold for all \(n\). In particular
\[ E(\hat{\beta_0}) = \beta_0 \ \ \text{and} \ \  E(\hat{\beta_1}) = \beta_1,\]
that is, \(\hat\beta_0\) and \(\hat\beta_1\) are unbiased estimators of
\(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), the true parameters. If the sample is
sufficiently large, by the central limit theorem the \emph{joint}
sampling distribution of the estimators is well approximated by the
bivariate normal distribution (2.1). This implies that the marginal
distributions are also normal in large samples. Core facts on the
large-sample distributions of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are presented
in Key Concept 4.4.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Large Sample Distribution of $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$]{4.4}
If the least squares assumptions in Key Concept 4.3 hold, then in large samples $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ have a joint normal sampling distribution. The large sample normal distribution of $\hat\beta_1$ is $N(\beta_1, \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1})$, where the variance of the distribution, $\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1}$, is 

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1} = \frac{1}{n} \frac{Var \left[ \left(X_i - \mu_X \right) u_i  \right]}  {\left[  Var \left(X_i \right)  \right]^2}.
\end{equation}

The large sample normal distribution of $\hat\beta_0$ is $N(\beta_0, \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_0})$ with

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_0} =  \frac{1}{n} \frac{Var \left( H_i u_i \right)}{ \left[  E \left(H_i^2  \right)  \right]^2 } \ , \ \text{where} \ \ H_i = 1 - \left[ \frac{\mu_X} {E \left( X_i^2\right)} \right] X_i.
\end{equation}

The interactive simulation below continuously generates random samples $(X_i,Y_i)$ of $200$ observations where $E(Y\vert X) = 100 + 3X$, estimates a simple regression model, stores the estimate of the slope $\beta_1$ and visualizes the distribution of the $\widehat{\beta}_1$s observed so far using a histogram. The idea here is that for a large number of $\widehat{\beta}_1$s, the histogram gives a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the estimator. By decreasing the time between two sampling iterations, it becomes clear that the shape of the histogram approaches the characteristic bell shape of a normal distribution centered at the true slope of $3$.\vspace{0.5cm}

\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{Simulation Study 1}\label{simulation-study-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study 1}

Whether the statements of Key Concept 4.4 really hold can also be
verified using \texttt{R}. For this we first we build our own population
of \(100000\) observations in total. To do this we need values for the
independent variable \(X\), for the error term \(u\), and for the
parameters \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\). With these combined in a simple
regression model, we compute the dependent variable \(Y\). In our
example we generate the numbers \(X_i\), \(i = 1\), \ldots{} ,\(100000\)
by drawing a random sample from a uniform distribution on the interval
\([0,20]\). The realizations of the error terms \(u_i\) are drawn from a
standard normal distribution with parameters \(\mu = 0\) and
\(\sigma^2 = 100\) (note that \texttt{rnorm()} requires \(\sigma\) as
input for the argument \texttt{sd}, see \texttt{?rnorm}). Furthermore we
chose \(\beta_0 = -2\) and \(\beta_1 = 3.5\) so the true model is

\[ Y_i = -2 + 3.5 \cdot X_i. \]

Finally, we store the results in a data.frame.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}

From now on we will consider the previously generated data as the true
population (which of course would be \emph{unknown} in a real world
application, otherwise there would be no reason to draw a random sample
in the first place). The knowledge about the true population and the
true relationship between \(Y\) and \(X\) can be used to verify the
statements made in Key Concept 4.4.

First, let us calculate the true variances \(\sigma^2_{\hat{\beta}_0}\)
and \(\sigma^2_{\hat{\beta}_1}\) for a randomly drawn sample of size
\(n = 100\).

Now let us assume that we do not know the true values of \(\beta_0\) and
\(\beta_1\) and that it is not possible to observe the whole population.
However, we can observe a random sample of \(n\) observations. Then, it
would not be possible to compute the true parameters but we could obtain
estimates of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) from the sample data using OLS.
However, we know that these estimates are outcomes of random variables
themselves since the observations are randomly sampled from the
population. Key Concept 4.4. describes their distributions for large
\(n\). When drawing a single sample of size \(n\) it is not possible to
make any statement about these distributions. Things change if we repeat
the sampling scheme many times and compute the estimates for each
sample: using this procedure we simulate outcomes of the respective
distributions.

To achieve this in R, we employ the following approach:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We assign the number of repetitions, say \(10000\), to \texttt{reps}
  and then initialize a matrix \texttt{fit} were the estimates obtained
  in each sampling iteration shall be stored row-wise. Thus \texttt{fit}
  has to be a matrix of dimensions \texttt{reps}\(\times2\).
\item
  In the next step we draw \texttt{reps} random samples of size
  \texttt{n} from the population and obtain the OLS estimates for each
  sample. The results are stored as row entries in the outcome matrix
  \texttt{fit}. This is done using a \texttt{for()} loop.
\item
  At last, we estimate variances of both estimators using the sampled
  outcomes and plot histograms of the latter. We also add a plot of the
  density functions belonging to the distributions that follow from Key
  Concept 4.4. The function \texttt{bquote()} is used to obtain math
  expressions in the titles and labels of both plots. See
  \texttt{?bquote}.

We are now able to say the following: first, our variance estimates are
in favor of the claims made in Key Concept 4.4 since they come close to
the computed theoretical values. Second, the histograms suggest that the
distributions of the estimators can be well approximated by the
respective theoretical normal distributions stated in Key Concept 4.4.

\subsection*{Simulation Study 2}\label{simulation-study-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study 2}

A further result implied by Key Concept 4.4 is that both estimators are
consistent i.e.~they converge in probability to the true parameters we
are interested in. This is since their variances converge to \(0\) as
\(n\) increases. We can check this by repeating the simulation above for
an increasing sequence of sample sizes. This means we no longer assign
the sample size but a \emph{vector} of sample sizes:
\texttt{n <- c(...)}. Let us look at the distributions of \(\beta_1\).
The idea here is to add an additional call of \texttt{for()} to the
code. This is done in order to loop over the vector of sample sizes
\texttt{n}. For each of the sample sizes we carry out the same
simulation as before but plot a density estimate for the outcomes of
each iteration over \texttt{n}. Notice that we have to change \texttt{n}
to \texttt{n[j]} in the inner loop to ensure that the
\texttt{j}\(^{th}\) element of \texttt{n} is used. In the simulation, we
use sample sizes of \(100, 250, 1000\) and \(3000\). Consequently we
have a total of four distinct simulations using different sample sizes.

We find that, as \(n\) increases, the distribution of \(\hat\beta_1\)
concentrates around its mean, i.e.~its variance decreases. Put
differently, the likelihood of observering estimates close to the true
value of \(\beta_1 = 3.5\) grows as we increase the sample size. The
same behavior can be observed if we analyze the distribution of
\(\hat\beta_0\) instead.

\subsection*{Simulation Study 3}\label{simulation-study-3}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study 3}

Furthermore, (4.1) reveals that the variance of the OLS estimator for
\(\beta_1\) decreases as the variance of the \(X_i\) increases. In other
words, as we increase the amount of information provided by the
regressor, that is, increasing \(Var(X)\), which is used to estimate
\(\beta_1\), we are more confident that the estimate is close to the
true value (i.e. \(Var(\hat\beta_1)\) decreases). We can visualize this
by reproducing Figure 4.6 from the book. To do this, we sample
observations \((X_i,Y_i)\), \(i=1,\dots,100\) from a bivariate normal
distribution with

\[E(X)=E(Y)=5,\] \[Var(X)=Var(Y)=5\] and \[Cov(X,Y)=4.\]

Formally, this is written down as

\begin{align}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} & \ \mathcal{N} 
  \left[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      5 \\
      5 \\
    \end{pmatrix}, \ 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      5 & 4 \\
      4 & 5 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \right]. \tag{4.3}
\end{align}

To carry out the random sampling, we make use of the function
\texttt{mvrnorm()} from the package \texttt{MASS} \citep{R-MASS} which
allows to draw random samples from multivariate normal distributions,
see \texttt{?mvtnorm}. Next, we use \texttt{subset()} to split the
sample into two subsets such that the first set, \texttt{set1}, consists
of observations that fulfill the condition
\(\lvert X - \overline{X} \rvert > 1\) and the second set,
\texttt{set2}, includes the remainder of the sample. We then plot both
sets and use different colors to make the observations distinguishable.

It is clear that observations that are close to the sample average of
the \(X_i\) have less variance than those that are farther away. Now, if
we were to draw a line as accurately as possible through either of the
two sets it is obvious that choosing the observations indicated by the
black dots, i.e.~using the set of observations which has larger variance
than the blue ones, would result in a more precise line. Now, let us use
OLS to estimate slope and intercept for both sets of observations. We
then plot the observations along with both regression lines.

Evidently, the green regression line does far better in describing data
sampled from the bivariate normal distribution stated in (4.3) than the
red line. This is a nice example for demonstrating why we are interested
in a high variance of the regressor \(X\): more variance in the \(X_i\)
means more information from which the precision of the estimation
benefits.

\chapter{Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals in the Simple Linear
Regression Model}\label{htaciitslrm}

In this chapter, we continue our treatment of the simple linear
regression model. The following subsections discuss how we may use our
knowledge about the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator in order
to make statements regarding its uncertainty.

These subsections cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Testing Hypotheses regarding regression coefficients.
\item
  Confidence intervals for regression coefficients.
\item
  Regression when \(X\) is a dummy variable.
\item
  Heteroskedasticity and Homoskedasticity.
\end{itemize}

The packages \texttt{AER} \citep{R-AER} and \texttt{scales}
\citep{R-scales} are required for reproduction of the code chunks
presented throughout this chapter. The package \texttt{scales} provides
additional generic plot scaling methods. Make sure both packages are
installed before you proceed. The safest way to do so is by checking
whether the following code chunk executes without any errors.

\section{Testing Two-Sided Hypotheses Concerning the Slope
Coefficient}\label{testing-two-sided-hypotheses-concerning-the-slope-coefficient}

Using the fact that \(\hat{\beta}_1\) is approximately normally
distributed in large samples (see \protect\hyperlink{tsdotoe}{Key
Concept 4.4}), testing hypotheses about the true value \(\beta_1\) can
be done with the same approach as discussed in Chapter \ref{potsm}.

\begin{keyconcepts}[General Form of the $t$-Statistic]{5.1}
Remember from Chapter \ref{arosur} that a general $t$-statistic has the form
$$ t = \frac{\text{estimated value} - \text{hypothesized value}}{\text{standard error of the estimator}}.$$
\end{keyconcepts}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Testing Hypotheses regarding $\beta_1$]{5.2}
For testing the hypothesis $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_{1,0}$, we need to perform the following steps:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the standard error of $\hat{\beta}_1$, $SE(\hat{\beta}_1)$

\[ SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = \sqrt{ \hat{\sigma}^2_{\hat{\beta}_1} } \ \ , \ \ 
  \hat{\sigma}^2_{\hat{\beta}_1} = \frac{1}{n} \times \frac{\frac{1}{n-2} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \hat{u_i}^2 }{ \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right]^2}.
\]

\item Compute the $t$-statistic

\[ t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_{1,0}}{ SE(\hat{\beta}_1) }. \]

\item Given a two sided alternative ($H_1:\beta_1 \neq \beta_{1,0}$) we reject at the $5\%$ level if $|t^{act}| > 1.96$ or, equivalently, if the $p$-value is less than $0.05$.\newline  
Recall the definition of the $p$-value:  

  \begin{align*}
    p \text{-value} =& \, \text{Pr}_{H_0} \left[ \left| \frac{ \hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_{1,0} }{ SE(\hat{\beta}_1) } \right| > \left|        \frac{ \hat{\beta}_1^{act} - \beta_{1,0} }{ SE(\hat{\beta}_1) } \right| \right] \\
    =& \, \text{Pr}_{H_0} (|t| > |t^{act}|) \\
    =& \, 2 \cdot \Phi(-|t^{act}|)
  \end{align*}  

The last equality holds due to the normal approximation for large samples.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

Consider again the OLS regression stored in \texttt{linear\_model} from
Chapter \ref{lrwor} that gave us the regression line

\[ \widehat{TestScore} \ = \underset{(9.47)}{698.9} - \underset{(0.49)}{2.28} \times STR \ , \ R^2=0.051 \ , \ SER=18.6. \]

For testing a hypothesis concerning the slope parameter (the coefficient
on \(STR\)), we need \(SE(\hat{\beta}_1)\), the standard error of the
respective point estimator. As common in the literature, standard errors
are presented in parentheses below the point estimates.

Key Concept 5.1 states that it is rather cumbersome to compute the
standard error and thereby the \(t\)-statistic by hand. The question you
should be asking yourself right now is: can we obtain these values with
minimum effort using \texttt{R}? Yes, we can. Let us first use
\texttt{summary()} to get a summary on the estimated coefficients in
\texttt{linear\_model}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# print the summary of the coefficients to the console}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##               Estimate Std. Error   t value      Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept) 698.932949  9.4674911 73.824516 6.569846e-242
## STR          -2.279808  0.4798255 -4.751327  2.783308e-06
\end{verbatim}

Looking at the second column of the coefficients' summary, we discover
values for \(SE(\hat\beta_0)\) and \(SE(\hat\beta_1)\). Also, in the
third column \texttt{t value}, we find \(t\)-statistics \(t^{act}\)
suitable for tests of the separate hypotheses \(H_0: \beta_0=0\) and
\(H_0: \beta_1=0\). Furthermore, the output provides us with
\(p\)-values corresponding to both tests against the two-sided
alternatives \(H_1:\beta_0\neq0\) respectively \(H_1:\beta_1\neq0\) in
the fourth column of the table.

Let us have a closer look at the test of

\[H_0: \beta_1=0 \ \ \ vs. \ \ \ H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0.\]

Using our revisited knowledge about \(t\)-statistics we find that

\[ t^{act} = \frac{-2.279808 - 0}{0.4798255} \approx - 4.75. \]

What does this tell us about the significance of the estimated
coefficient? We reject the null hypothesis at the \(5\%\) level of
significance since \(|t^{act}| > 1.96\) that is the observed test
statistic falls into the region of rejection. Or, alternatively as
leading to the same result, we have
\(p\text{-value} = 2.78*10^{-6} < 0.05\). We conclude that the
coefficient is significantly different from zero. With other words, our
analysis provides evidence that the class size \emph{has an influence}
on the students test scores. \(\beta_1\) is significantly different from
\(0\) at the level of \(5\%\).

Note that, although the difference is negligible in the present case as
we will see later, \texttt{summary()} does not perform the normal
approximation but calculates \(p\)-values using the \(t\)-distribution
instead. Generally, the degrees of freedom of the assumed
\(t\)-distribution are determined in the following manner:

\[ \text{DF} = n - k - 1 \]

where \(n\) is the number of observations used to estimate the model and
\(k\) is the number of regressors, excluding the intercept. In our case,
we have \(n=420\) observations and the only regressor is \(STR\) so
\(k=1\). The simplest way to determine the model degrees of freedom is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# determine residual degrees of freedom}
\NormalTok{linear_model}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{df.residual}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 418
\end{verbatim}

Hence, for the assumed sampling distribution of \(\hat\beta_1\) we have

\[\hat\beta_1 \sim t_{418}\] such that the \(p\)-value for a two-sided
significance test can be obtained by executing the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{pt}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\FloatTok{4.751327}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{df =} \DecValTok{418}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 2.78331e-06
\end{verbatim}

The result is very close to the value provided by \texttt{summary()}.
However since \(n\) is sufficiently large one could just as well use the
standard normal density to compute the \(p\)-value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{pnorm}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{-}\FloatTok{4.751327}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 2.02086e-06
\end{verbatim}

The difference is indeed negligible. These findings tell us that, if
\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\) is true and we were to repeat the whole process of
gathering observations and estimating the model, chances of observing a
\(\hat\beta_1 \geq |-4.75|\) are roughly \(1:359285\) --- so higher
chances than winning the lottery next Saturday but still very unlikely!

Using \texttt{R} we may visualize how such a statement is made when
using the normal approximation. This reflects the principles depicted in
figure 5.1 in the book. Do not let the following code chunk deter you:
the code is somewhat longer than the usual examples and looks
unappealing but there is \textbf{a lot} of repetition since color
shadings and annotations are added on both tails of the normal
distribution. We recommend to execute the code step by step in order to
see how the graph is augmented with the annotations.

The \(p\)-Value is the area under the curve to left of \(-4.75\) plus
the area under the curve to the right of \(4.75\). As we already know
from the calculations above, this value is very small.

\section{Confidence Intervals for Regression Coefficients}\label{cifrc}

As we already know, estimates of the regression coefficients \(\beta_0\)
and \(\beta_1\) are afflicted with sampling uncertainty, see Chapter
\ref{lrwor}. Therefore, we will \emph{never} estimate the exact true
value of these parameters from sample data in an empirical application.
However, we may construct confidence intervals for the intercept and the
slope parameter.

A \(95\%\) confidence interval for \(\beta_i\) has two equivalent
definitions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The interval is the set of values for which a hypothesis test to the
  level of \(5\%\) cannot be rejected.
\item
  The interval has a probability of \(95\%\) to contain the true value
  of \(\beta_i\). So in \(95\%\) of all samples that could be drawn, the
  confidence interval will cover the true value of \(\beta_i\).
\end{itemize}

We also say that the interval has a confidence level of \(95\%\). The
idea of the confidence interval is summarized in Key Concept 5.3.

\begin{keyconcepts}[A Confidence Interval for $\beta_i$]{5.3}
Imagine you could draw all possible random samples of given size. The interval that contains the true value $\beta_i$ in $95\%$ of all samples is given by the expression

\[ \text{KI}_{0.95}^{\beta_i} = \left[ \hat{\beta}_i - 1.96 \times SE(\hat{\beta}_i) \, , \, \hat{\beta}_i + 1.96 \times SE(\hat{\beta}_i) \right]. \]

Equivalently, this interval can be seen as the set of null hypotheses for which a $5\%$ two-sided hypothesis test does not reject.
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{Simulation Study: Confidence
Intervals}\label{simulation-study-confidence-intervals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study: Confidence
Intervals}

To get a better understanding of confidence intervals we will conduct
another simulation study. For now, assume that we are confronted with
the following sample of \(n=100\) observations on a single variable
\(Y\) where

\[ Y_i \overset{i.i.d}{\sim} N(5,25) \ \ \forall \ i = 1, \dots, 100.\]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-197-1} \end{center}

We assume that the data is generated by the model

\[ Y_i = \mu + \epsilon_i \]

where \(\mu\) is an unknown constant and we know that
\(\epsilon_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,25)\). In this model, the OLS
estimator for \(\mu\) is given by

\[ \hat\mu = \overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \]

(can you verify this?) i.e.~the sample average of the \(Y_i\). It
further holds that

\[ SE(\hat\mu) = \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{100}} \]

(see Chapter \protect\hyperlink{SVSSDASE}{2}) A large sample \(95\%\)
confidence interval for \(\mu\) is then given by

\begin{equation} 
KI^{\mu}_{0.95} = \left[\hat\mu - 1.96 \times \frac{5}{\sqrt{100}} \ , \ \hat\mu + 1.96 \times \frac{5}{\sqrt{100}}  \right]. \label{eq:KI}
\end{equation}

It is fairly easy to compute this interval in \texttt{R} by hand. The
following code chunk generates a named vector containing the interval
bounds:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{cbind}\NormalTok{(}

\end{verbatim}

Knowing that \(\mu = 5\) we see that our example covers the true value
for the present sample. As opposed to real world examples, we can use
\texttt{R} to get a better understanding of confidence intervals by
repeatedly sampling data, estimating \(\mu\) and computing the
confidence interval for \(\mu\) as in \eqref{eq:KI}.

The procedure is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We initialize the vectors \texttt{lower} and \texttt{upper} in which
  the simulated interval limits are to be saved. We want to simulate
  \(10000\) intervals so both vectors are set to have this length.
\item
  We use a \texttt{for()} loop to sample \(100\) observations from the
  \(N(5,25)\) distribution and compute \(\hat\mu\) as well as the
  boundaries of the confidence interval in every iteration of the loop.
\item
  At last we join \texttt{lower} and \texttt{upper} in a matrix.
\end{itemize}

According to Key Concept 5.3 we expect that the fraction of the
\(10000\) simulated intervals saved in the matrix \texttt{CIs} that
contain the true value \(\mu=5\) should be roughly \(95\%\). We can
easily check this using logical operators.

The simulation shows that the fraction of intervals covering \(\mu=5\),
i.e.~those intervals for which \(H_0: \mu = 5\) cannot be rejected is
close to the theoretical value of \(95\%\).

Let us draw a plot of the first \(100\) simulated confidence intervals
and indicate those which \emph{do not} cover the true value of \(\mu\).
We do this by adding horizontal lines representing the confidence
intervals on top of each other.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-201-1} \end{center}

We find that for the first \(100\) samples, the true null hypothesis is
rejected in four cases so these intervals do not cover \(\mu=5\). We
have indicated the intervals which lead to a rejection of the true null
hypothesis by red color.

Let us now turn back to the example of test scores and class sizes. The
regression model from Chapter \ref{lrwor} is stored in
\texttt{linear\_model}. An easy way to get \(95\%\) confidence intervals
for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), the coefficients on
\texttt{(intercept)} and \texttt{STR}, is to use the function
\texttt{confint()}. We only have to provide a fitted model object as an
to this function. The confidence level is set to \(95\%\) by default but
can be modified by setting the argument \texttt{level}, see
\texttt{?confint}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{confint}\NormalTok{(linear_model)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##                 2.5 %     97.5 %
## (Intercept) 680.32312 717.542775
## STR          -3.22298  -1.336636
\end{verbatim}

Let us check if the calculation is done as we expect it to be. For
\(\beta_1\), the coefficient on \texttt{STR}, according to the formula
presented above the interval bounds are computed as

\[  -2.279808 \pm 1.96 \times 0.4798255 \, \Rightarrow \, \text{KI}_{0.95}^{\beta_1} = \left[ -3.22, -1.34 \right]  \]

so this actually leads to the same interval. Obviously, this interval
\emph{does not} contain the value zero which, as we have already seen in
the previous section, leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis
\(\beta_{1,0} = 0\).

\section{Regression when X is a Binary Variable}\label{rwxiabv}

Instead of using a continuous regressor \(X\), we might be interested in
running the regression

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + u_i \tag{5.2} \]

where \(D_i\) is a binary variable, a so-called \emph{dummy variable}.
For example, we may define \(D_i\) in the following way:

\[ D_i = \begin{cases}
        1 \ \ \text{if $STR$ in $i^{th}$ school district < 20} \\
        0 \ \ \text{if $STR$ in $i^{th}$ school district $\geq$ 20} \\
      \end{cases} \tag{5.3} \]

The regression model now is

\[ TestScore_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + u_i. \tag{5.4} \]

Let us see how these data look like in a scatter plot:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\NormalTok{     )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-204-1} \end{center}

We see that with \(D\) as the regressor, it is not useful to think of
\(\beta_1\) as a slope parameter since \(D_i \in \{0,1\}\), i.e.~we only
observe two discrete values instead of a continuum of regressor values
lying in some range on the real line. There is no continuous line
depicting the conditional expectation function \(E(TestScore_i | D_i)\)
since this function is solely defined for \(X\)-positions \(0\) and
\(1\).

Therefore, the interpretation of the coefficients in our regression
model is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(E(Y_i | D_i = 0) = \beta_0\), so \(\beta_0\) is the expected test
  score in districts where \(D_i=0\) i.e.~where \(STR\) is below \(20\).
\item
  \(E(Y_i | D_i = 1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\) or, using the result above,
  \(\beta_1 = E(Y_i | D_i = 1) - E(Y_i | D_i = 0)\). Thus, \(\beta_1\)
  is \emph{the difference in group specific expectations}, i.e.~the
  difference in expected test score between districts with \(STR < 20\)
  and those with \(STR \geq 20\).
\end{itemize}

We will now use \texttt{R} to estimate the dummy regression model as
defined by the equations (5.2) and (5.3) .

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

One can see that the expected test score in districts with \(STR < 20\)
(\(D_i = 1\)) is predicted to be \(650.1 + 7.17 = 657.27\) while
districts with \(STR \geq 20\) (\(D_i = 0\)) are expected to have an
average test score of only \(650.1\).

Group specific predictions can be added to the plot by execution of the
following code chunk.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

       \DataTypeTok{pch =} \DecValTok{20}
\NormalTok{       )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we use the function \texttt{predict()} to obtain estimates of the
group specific means. The red dots represent these sample group
averages. Accordingly, \(\hat{\beta}_1 = 7.17\) can be seen as the
difference in group averages.

\texttt{summary(dummy\_model)} also provides an answer to the question
whether there is a statistically significant difference in group means.
This in turn would support the hypothesis that students perform
differently when they are taught in small classes compared to those
taught in large classes. We can assess this by a two-tailed test of the
hypothesis \(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\). Conveniently, the \(t\)-statistic and
the corresponding \(p\)-value for this test are computed by
\texttt{summary()}.

Since \texttt{t value} \(= 3.88 > 1.96\) we reject the null hypothesis
at the \(5\%\) level of significance. The same conclusion can be made
when using the \(p\)-value which reports significance to the
\(0.00012\%\) level.

As done with \texttt{linear\_model}, we may alternatively use the
function \texttt{confint()} to compute a \(95\%\) confidence interval
for the true difference in means and see if the hypothesized value is an
element of this confidence set.

\end{verbatim}

We reject the hypothesis that there is no difference between group means
at the \(5\%\) significance level since \(\beta_{1,0} = 0\) lies outside
of \([3.54, 10.8]\), the \(95\%\) confidence interval for the
coefficient on \(D\).

\section{Heteroskedasticity and
Homoskedasticity}\label{heteroskedasticity-and-homoskedasticity}

All inference made in the previous chapters relies on the assumption
that the error variance does not vary as regressor values change. But
this will not necessarily be the case in empirical applications.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Heteroskedasticity and Homoskedasticity]{5.4}
\begin{itemize}
\item The error term of our regression model is homoskedastic if the variance of the conditional distribution of $u_i$ given $X_i$, $Var(u_i|X_i=x)$, is constant \textit{for all} observations in our sample:
\[ \text{Var}(u_i|X_i=x) = \sigma^2 \ \forall \ i=1,\dots,n. \]

\item If instead there is dependence of the conditional variance of $u_i$ on $X_i$, the error term is said to be heteroskedastic. We then write
\[ \text{Var}(u_i|X_i=x) = \sigma_i^2 \ \forall \ i=1,\dots,n. \]

\item Homoskedasticity is a \textit{special case} of heteroskedasticity.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

For a better understanding of heteroskedasticity, we generate some
bivariate heteroskedastic data, estimate a linear regression model and
then use box plots to depict the conditional distributions of the
residuals.

For this artificial data it is clear to see that we face unequal
conditional error variances. Specifically, we observe that the variance
in test scores (and therefore the variance of the errors committed)
\emph{increases} with the student teacher ratio.

\subsection*{A Real-World Example for
Heteroskedasticity}\label{a-real-world-example-for-heteroskedasticity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A Real-World Example for
Heteroskedasticity}

Think about the economic value of education: if there were no expected
economic value-added to receiving education at university, you probably
would not be reading this script right now. A starting point to
empirical verification of such a relation is to have data on graduates.
More precisely, we need data on wages and education of graduates in
order to estimate a model like

\[ wage_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot education_i + u_i. \]

What can be presumed about this relation? It is likely that, on average,
higher educated workers earn more than workers with less education, so
we expect to estimate an upward sloping regression line. Also it seems
plausible that earnings of better educated workers have a higher
dispersion then those of low-skilled workers: solid education is not a
guarantee for a high salary so even highly quialified workers take on
low-income jobs. However, they are more likely to meet the requirements
for the well-paid jobs than workers with less education for whom
opportunities at the labor market are much more limited.

To verify this empirically we may use real data on hourly earnings and
the number of years of education of employees. Such data can be found in
\texttt{CPSSWEducation}. This data set is part of the package
\texttt{AER} and stems from the Current Population Survey (CPS) which is
conducted periodically by the \href{http://www.bls.gov/}{Bureau of Labor
Statistics} in the United States.

The subsequent code chunks demonstrate how to import the data into
\texttt{R} and how to produce a plot in the fashion of Figure 5.3 in the
book.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-211-1} \end{center}

From inspecting the plot we can tell that the mean of the distribution
of earnings increases with the level of education. This is also
suggested by formal analysis: the estimated regression model stored in
\texttt{labor\_mod} shows that there is a positive relation between
years of education and earnings.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

## 
## Call:

## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)    education  
##      -3.134        1.467
\end{verbatim}

The estimated regression equation states that, on average, an additional
year of education increases a worker's hourly earnings by about
\(\$ 1.47\). Once more we use \texttt{confint()} to obtain a \(95\%\)
confidence interval for both regression coefficients.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{confint}\NormalTok{(labor_model)}

## (Intercept) -5.015248 -1.253495
## education    1.330098  1.603753
\end{verbatim}

Since the interval is \([1.33, 1.60]\) we can reject the hypothesis that
the coefficient on \texttt{education} is zero at the \(5\%\) level.

Furthermore, the plot indicates that there is heteroskedasticity: if we
assume the regression line to be a reasonably good representation of the
conditional mean function \(E(earnings_i\vert education_i)\), the
dispersion of hourly earnings around that function clearly increases
with the level of education, i.e.~the variance of the distribution of
earnings increases. In other words: the variance of the residuals (the
errors made in explaining earnings by education) increases with
education so that the regression errors are heteroskedastic.

This example makes a case that the assumption of homoskedasticity is
doubtful in economic applications. Should we care about
heteroskedasticity? In short, yes we shoud. As explained in the next
section, heteroskedasticity can have serious negative consequences in
hypothesis testing, if we ignore it.

\subsection*{Should We Care About
Heteroskedasticity?}\label{should-we-care-about-heteroskedasticity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Should We Care About
Heteroskedasticity?}

To answer the question whether we should worry about heteroskedasticity
being present, let us see how the variance of \(\hat\beta_1\) is
computed under the assumption of homoskedasticity. In this case we have

\[ \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1} = \frac{\sigma^2_u}{n \cdot \sigma^2_X} \tag{5.5} \]

which is a simplified version of the general equation (4.1) presented in
Key Concept 4.4. See Appendix 5.1 of the book for details on the
derivation. \texttt{summary()} estimates (5.5) by

\[ \overset{\sim}{\sigma}^2_{\hat\beta_1} = \frac{SER^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2} \ \ \text{where} \ \ SER=\frac{1}{n-2} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat u_i^2. \]

Thus \texttt{summary()} estimates the \emph{homoskedasticity-only}
standard error

\[ \sqrt{ \overset{\sim}{\sigma}^2_{\hat\beta_1} } = \sqrt{ \frac{SER^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \overline{X})^2} }. \]

This is in fact an estimator for the standard deviation of the estimator
\(\hat{\beta}_1\) that is \emph{inconsistent} for the true value
\(\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1}\) when there is heteroskedasticity. The
implication is that \(t\)-statistics computed in the manner of Key
Concept 5.1 do not have a standard normal distribution, even in large
samples. This issue may invalidate inference drawn when using the
previously treated tools for hypothesis testing: we should be cautious
when making statements about the significance of regression coefficients
on the basis of \(t\)-statistics as computed by \texttt{summary()} or
confidence intervals produced by \texttt{confint()} if it is doubtful
for the assumption of homoskedasticity to hold!

We will now use \texttt{R} to compute the homoskedasticity-only standard
error for \(\hat{\beta}_1\) in the test score regression model
\texttt{linear\_model} by hand and see that it matches the value
produced by \texttt{summary()}.

\subsection*{Computation of Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard
Errors}\label{computation-of-heteroskedasticity-robust-standard-errors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Computation of
Heteroskedasticity-Robust Standard Errors}

Consistent estimation of \(\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_1}\) under
heteroskedasticity is granted when the following \emph{robust} estimator
is used.

\[ SE(\hat{\beta}_1) = \sqrt{ \frac{ \frac{1}{n-2} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \hat{u}_i^2 }{ \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2  \right]^2} } \tag{5.6} \]

Standard error estimates computed this way are also referred to as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors}{Eicker-Huber-White
standard errors}, the most frequently cited paper on this is
\citet{white1980}.\\
It can be quite cumbersome to do this calculation by hand. Luckily,
there are \texttt{R} function for that purpose. A convenient one named
\texttt{vcovHC()} is part of the package \texttt{sandwich}.\footnote{The
  package \texttt{sandwich} is a dependency of the package \texttt{AER}
  meaning that it is attached automatically if you load \texttt{AER}}.
This function can compute a variety of standard errors. The one brought
forward in (5.6) is computed when the argument \texttt{type} is set to
\texttt{"HC0"}. Most of the examples presented in the book rely on a
slightly different formula which is computed by \emph{STATA} by default.
To get \texttt{vcovHC()} to use this formula, we have to set
\texttt{type = HC1}.

Let us now compute robust standard error estimates for the coefficients
in \texttt{linear\_model}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# compute heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors}
\NormalTok{vcov <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{vcovHC}\NormalTok{(linear_model, }\DataTypeTok{type =} \StringTok{"HC1"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{vcov}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##             (Intercept)        STR
## (Intercept)  107.419993 -5.3639114
## STR           -5.363911  0.2698692
\end{verbatim}

The output of \texttt{vcovHC()} is the variance-covariance matrix of
coefficient estimates. We are interested in the square root of the
diagonal elements of this matrix since these values are the standard
error estimates we seek.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdknit}
When we have k \textgreater{} 1 regressors, writing down the equations
for a regression model becomes very messy. A more convinient way to
denote and estimate so-called multiple regression models is by using
matrix algebra. This is why functions like vcovHC() produce matrices. In
the simple linear regression model, the variances and covariances of the
coefficient estimators can be gathered in the variance-covariance matrix

\begin{equation}
\text{Var}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \hat\beta_0 \\
    \hat\beta_1
  \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  \text{Var}(\hat\beta_0) & \text{Cov}(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1) \\
\text{Cov}(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1) & \text{Var}(\hat\beta_1)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

which is a symmetric matrix. So vcovHC() gives us
\(\widehat{\text{Var}}(\hat\beta_0)\),
\(\widehat{\text{Var}}(\hat\beta_1)\) and
\(\widehat{\text{Cov}}(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1)\) but most of the time
we are interested in the diagonal elements of the estimated matrix.

Now assume we want to generate a coefficient summary as provided by
\texttt{summary()} but with \emph{robust} standard errors of the
coefficient estimators, robust \(t\)-statistics and corresponding
\(p\)-values for the regression model \texttt{linear\_model}. This can
be done using \texttt{coeftest()} from the package \texttt{lmtest}, see
\texttt{?coeftest}. Further we specify in the argument \texttt{vcov.}
that \texttt{vcov}, the Eicker-Huber-White estimate of the variance
matrix we have computed before, should be used.

We see that values reported in the column \texttt{Std. Error} are equal
to the ones received using \texttt{sqrt(diag(vcov))}.

How severe are the implications of using homoskedasticity-only standard
errors in the presence of heteroskedasticity? The answer is: it depends.
As mentioned above we may face the risk of drawing wrong conclusions
when conducting significance tests. Let us illustrate this by generating
another example of a heteroskedastic data set and use it to estimate a
simple regression model. We take

\[ Y_i = \beta_1 \cdot X_i + u_i \ \ , \ \ u_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,0.36 \cdot X_i^2)  \]

with \(\beta_1=1\) as the data generating process. Clearly the
assumption of homoskedasticity is violated here since the variance of
the errors is a nonlinear, increasing function of \(X_i\) but the errors
have zero mean and are i.i.d. such that the assumptions made in Key
Concept 4.3 are not violated. As before, the true conditional mean
function we are interested in estimating is

\[ E(Y_i\vert X_i) = \beta_1 X_i. \]

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-219-1} \end{center}

The plot shows that the data are heteroskedastic as the variance of
\(Y\) grows with \(X\). We continue by conducting a significance test of
the (true) null hypothesis \(H_0: \beta_1 = 1\) twice, once using the
homoskedasticity-only standard error formula and once with the robust
version (5.6). An easy way to do this in \texttt{R} is the function
\texttt{linearHypothesis()} from the package \texttt{car}, see
\texttt{?linearHypothesis}. It allows to test linear hypotheses about
parameters in linear models in a similar way as done with a
\(t\)-statistic and offers various robust covariance matrix estimators.
We test by comparing the tests' \(p\)-values to the significance level
of \(5\%\).

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdknit}
linearHypothesis() computes a test statistic that follows an
\(F\)-distribution under the null hypothesis. We will not loose too much
words on the theory behind it at this time. In general, the idea of the
\(F\)-test is to compare the fit of different models. When testing a
hypothesis about a \emph{single} coefficient using an \(F\)-test, one
can show that the test statistic is simply the square of the
corresponding \(t\)-statistic:

\[ F = t^2 = \frac{\hat\beta_i - \beta_{i,0}}{SE(\hat\beta_i)} \sim F_{1,n-k-1}  \]

In linearHypothesis(), the hypothesis must be provided as a
\emph{string}. The function returns an object of class anova which
contains further information on the test that can be accessed using the
\$ operator.

This is a good example of what can go wrong if we ignore
heteroskedasticity: for the data set at hand the default method rejects
the null hypothesis \(\beta_1 = 1\) although it is true. When using the
robust standard error formula the test does not reject the null. Of
course we could argue that this is just a coincidence and both tests are
equally well in maintaining the type I error rate of \(5\%\). This can
be further investigated by computing \emph{Monte Carlo} estimates of the
rejection frequencies of both tests on the basis of a large number of
random samples. We proceed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  initialize vectors \texttt{t} and \texttt{t.rob}.
\item
  Using a \texttt{for()} loop, we generate \(10000\) heteroskedastic
  random samples of size \(1000\), estimate the regression model and
  check whether the tests falsly reject the null at the level of \(5\%\)
  using comparison operators. The results are stored in the respective
  vectors \texttt{t} and \texttt{t.rob}.
\item
  After the simulation, we compute the fraction of false rejections for
  both tests.

These results show that we face an increased risk of falsely rejecting
the null using the homoskedasticity-only standard error for the testing
problem at hand: with the common standard error estimator, \(7.28\%\) of
all tests reject the null hypothesis falsely. In contrast, with the
robust test statistic we are closer to the nominal level of \(5\%\).

\section{The Gauss-Markov Theorem}\label{the-gauss-markov-theorem}

When estimating regression models, we know that the results of the
estimation procedure are outcomes of a random process. However, when
using unbiased estimators, at least on average, we estimate the true
parameter. When comparing different unbiased estimators, it is therefore
interesting to know which one has the highest precision: being aware
that the likelihood of estimating the \emph{exact} value of the
parameter of interest is \(0\) in an empirical application, we want to
make sure that the likelihood of obtaining an estimate very close to the
true value is as high as possible. This means we want to use the
estimator with the lowest variance of all unbiased estimators. The
Gauss-Markov theorem states that, in the class of conditionally unbiased
linear estimators, the OLS estimator has this property under certain
conditions.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Gauss-Markov Theorem for $\hat{\beta}_1$]{5.5}
Suppose that the assumptions made in Key Concept 4.3 hold \textit{and} that the errors are \textit{homoskedastic}. The OLS estimator is the best (in the sense of smallest variance) linear conditionally unbiased estimator (BLUE) in this setting.\newline

Let us have a closer look at what this means:\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimators of $\beta_1$ that are linear functions of the $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ and that are unbiased conditionally on the regressor $X_1, \dots, X_n$ can be written as \[ \overset{\sim}{\beta}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i Y_i \] where the $a_i$ are weights that are allowed to depend on the $X_i$ but \textit{not} on the $Y_i$. 

\item We already know that $\overset{\sim}{\beta}_1$ has a sampling distribution: $\overset{\sim}{\beta}_1$ is a linear function of the $Y_i$ which are random variables. If now \[ E(\overset{\sim}{\beta}_1 | X_1, \dots, X_n) = \beta_1, \] $\overset{\sim}{\beta}_1$ is a linear unbiased estimator of $\beta_1$, conditionally on the $X_1, \dots, X_n$.

\item We may ask if $\overset{\sim}{\beta}_1$ is also the \textit{best} estimator in this class, i.e. the most efficient one of all linear conditionally unbiased estimators where "most efficient" means smallest variance. The weights $a_i$ play an important role here and it turns out that OLS uses just the right weights to have the BLUE property.

\subsection*{Simulation Study: BLUE
Estimator}\label{simulation-study-blue-estimator}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study: BLUE Estimator}

Consider the case of a regression of \(Y_i,\dots,Y_n\) only on a
constant. Here, the \(Y_i\) are assumed to be a random sample from a
population with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\). We know that the
OLS estimator in this model is simply the sample mean:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}_1 = \overline{\beta}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \underbrace{\frac{1}{n}}_{=a_i} Y_i \label{eq:bluemean}
\end{equation}

Clearly, each observation is weighted by

\[a_i = \frac{1}{n}.\]

and we also know that
\(\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1)=\text{Var}(\hat\beta_1)=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\).

We will now use \texttt{R} to conduct a simulation study that
demonstrates what happens to the variance of \eqref{eq:bluemean} if
different weights \[ w_i = \frac{1 \pm \epsilon}{n} \] are assigned to
either half of the sample \(Y_1, \dots, Y_n\) instead of using
\(\frac{1}{n}\), the weights implied by OLS.

What conclusion can we draw from the result?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both estimators seem to be unbiased: the means of their estimated
  distributions are zero.
\item
  The estimator using weights that deviate from those implied by OLS is
  less efficient than the OLS estimator: there is higher dispersion when
  weights are \(w_i = \frac{1 \pm 0.8}{100}\) instead of
  \(w_i=\frac{1}{100}\) as required by the OLS solution.
\end{itemize}

Hence, our simulation results confirm what is stated by the Gauss-Markov
Theorem.

\section{Using the t-Statistic in Regression When the Sample Size Is
Small}\label{using-the-t-statistic-in-regression-when-the-sample-size-is-small}

The three OLS assumptions discussed in Chapter \ref{lrwor} (see Key
Concept 4.3) are the foundation for the results on the large sample
distribution of the OLS estimators in the simple regression model. What
can be said about the distribution of the estimators and their
\(t\)-statistics when the sample size is small and the population
distribution of the data is unknown? Provided that the three least
squares assumptions hold and the errors are normally distributed and
homoskedastic (we refer to these conditions as the homoskedastic normal
regression assumptions), we have normally distributed estimators and
\(t\)-distributed test statistics in small samples.

Recall the \protect\hyperlink{thetdist}{definition} of a
\(t\)-distributed variable

\[ \frac{Z}{\sqrt{W/m}} \sim t_m\]

where \(Z\) is a standard normal random variable, \(W\) is \(\chi^2\)
distributed with \(m\) degrees of freedom and \(Z\) and \(W\) are
independent. See section 5.6 in the book for a more detailed discussion
of the small sample distribution of \(t\)-statistics in regression.

Let us simulate the distribution of regression \(t\)-statistics based on
a large number of small random samples when the sample size is small,
say \(n=20\), and compare their simulated distributions to their
theoretical distribution which should be \(t_{18}\), the
\(t\)-distribution with \(18\) degrees of freedom (recall that
\(\text{DF}=n-k-1\)).

\chapter{Regression Models with Multiple Regressors}\label{rmwmr}

In what follows we introduce linear regression models that use more than
just one explanatory variable and discuss important key concepts in
multiple regression. As we broaden our scope beyond the relationship of
only two variables (the dependent and a single regressor) some potential
issues arise such as \emph{multicollinearity} and \emph{omitted variable
bias} (OVB). In particular, this chapter deals with omitted variables
and their hazard to causal interpretation of OLS-estimated coefficients.

Naturally, we will introduce estimation of multiple regression models
using \texttt{R}. We will also advocate thoughtful usage of multiple
regression models by doing simulation studies that demonstrate the
consequences of using highly correlated regressors or a misspecified
model.

The packages \texttt{AER} \citep{R-AER} and \texttt{MASS} \citep{R-MASS}
are needed for reproducing the code presented in this chapter. Make sure
that the following code chunk executes without any errors.

\section{Omitted Variable Bias}\label{omitted-variable-bias}

The previous analysis of the relationship between test score and class
size discussed in Chapters \ref{lrwor} and \ref{htaciitslrm} has a major
flaw: we ignored other determinants of the dependent variable (test
score) that correlate with the regressor (class size). Remember that
influences on the dependent variable which are not captured by the model
are collected in the error term which we assume to be uncorrelated with
the regressor. However, this assumption is violated if we exclude
determinants of the dependent variable which vary with the regressor.
This might induce an estimation bias, i.e.~the mean of the OLS
estimator's sampling distribution is no longer equal to the true mean.
In our example we therefore estimate the effect on test scores of a unit
change in the student-teacher ratio wrongly, on average. This issue is
called \emph{omitted variable bias} (OVB) and is summarized by Key
Concept 6.1.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Omitted Variable Bias in Regression with a Single Regressor]{6.1}
Omitted variable bias is the bias in the OLS estimator that arises when the regressor, $X$, is \textit{correlated} with an omitted variable. For omitted variable bias to occur, two conditions must be fulfilled:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is correlated with the omitted variable. 
\item The omitted variable is a determinant of the dependent variable $Y$.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

Together, 1. and 2. result in a violation of the first OLS assumption $E(u_i\vert X_i) = 0$. Formally, the resulting bias can be expressed as

\begin{align}
\hat\beta_1 \xrightarrow[]{p} \beta_1 + \rho_{Xu} \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_X}.
\end{align}

See Appendix 6.1 of the book for a detailed derivation. (6.1) states that OVB is a problem that cannot be alleviated by increasing the number of observations used to estimate $\beta_1$ since then $\hat\beta_1$ is inconsistent: OVB prevents the estimator from converging in probability to the true parameter value. Strength and direction of the bias are determined by $\rho_{Xu}$, the correlation between the error term and the regressor.
\end{keyconcepts}

In the example of test score and class size, it is easy to come up with
variables that may cause such a bias, if omitted from the model. As
mentioned in the book, a highly relevant variable could be the
percentage of English learners in the school district: it is plausible
that the ability to speak, read and write English is an important factor
for successful learning. Therefore, students that are still learning
English are likely to perform worse in the tests than native speakers.
Also, it is conceivable that the share of English learning students is
bigger in school districts where class sizes are relatively large: think
of poor urban districts were a lot of immigrants live.

Let us think about a possible bias induced by omitting the share of
English learning students (\(PctEL\)) in view of (6.1). When the
estimated regression model does not include \(PctEL\) as a regressor
although the true data generating process (DGP) is

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times PctEL \tag{6.2}\]

where \(STR\) and \(PctEL\) are correlated, we have

\[\rho_{STR,PctEL}\neq0.\]

Let us investigate this using \texttt{R}. After defining our variables
we may compute the correlation between \(STR\) and \(PctEL\) as well as
the correlation between \(STR\) and \(TestScore\).

\end{verbatim}

The fact that \(\widehat{\rho}_{STR, Testscore} = -0.2264\) is cause for
concern that omitting \(PctEL\) leads to a negatively biased estimate
\(\hat\beta_1\) since this indicates that \(\rho_{Xu} < 0\) and we have
\(\sigma_X>0\), \(\sigma_u>0\) by definition. As a consequence we expect
\(\hat\beta_1\), the coefficient on \(STR\), to be too large in absolute
value. Put differently, the OLS estimate of \(\hat\beta_1\) suggests
that small classes improve test scores but the effect of small classes
is overestimated as it captures the effect of having fewer English
learners, too.

What happens to the magnitude of \(\hat\beta_1\) if we add the variable
\(PctEL\) to the regression, that is, if we estimate the model
\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times PctEL + u \]

instead? And what do we expect about the sign of \(\hat\beta_2\), the
estimated coefficient on \(PctEL\)? Following the reasoning above we
should still end up with a negative but larger coefficient estimate
\(\hat\beta_1\) than before and a negative estimate \(\hat\beta_2\).

Let us estimate both regression models and compare. Performing a
multiple regression in \texttt{R} is straightforward. One can simply add
additional variables to the right hand side of the \texttt{formula}
argument of the function \texttt{lm()} by using their names and the
\texttt{+} operator. Notice that \texttt{english} is the name of the
column in the data set \texttt{CASchools} which contains observations on
the share of English learning students.

We find the outcomes to be consistent with our expectations.

The following section discusses some theory on multiple regression
models.

\section{The Multiple Regression
Model}\label{the-multiple-regression-model}

In the multiple regression model we extend the basic concept of the
simple regression model discussed in Chapters \ref{lrwor} and
\ref{htaciitslrm}. A multiple regression model enables us to estimate
the effect on \(Y_i\) of changing a regressor \(X_{1i}\) if the
remaining regressors \(X_{2i},X_{3i}\dots,X_{ki}\) \emph{do not vary}.
In fact we already have performed estimation of the multiple regression
model (6.2) using \texttt{R} in the previous section. Recall that the
interpretation of the coefficient on student-teacher ratio is the effect
on test scores of a one unit change student-teacher ratio if the
percentage of English learners is kept constant.

Just like in the simple regression model, we assume the true
relationship between \(Y\) and \(X_{1i},X_{2i}\dots\dots,X_{ki}\) to be
linear. On average, this relation is given by the population regression
function

\[ E(Y_i\vert X_{1i}=x_1, X_{2i}=x_2,  X_{3i}=x_3,\dots, X_{ki}=x_k) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \dots + \beta_k x_k. \tag{6.3} \]

As in the simple regression model, this relation does not hold exactly
since there are disturbing influences to the dependent variable \(Y\) we
cannot observe as explanatory variables. Therefore we add an error term
\(u\) which represents deviations of the observations from the
population regression line to (6.3). This yields the population multiple
regression model

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n. \tag{6.4} \]

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Multiple Regression Model]{6.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item $Y_i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation in the dependent variable. Observations on the $k$ regressors are denoted by $X_{1i},X_{2i},\dots,X_{ki}$ and $u_i$ is the error term.
\item The average relationship between $Y$ and the regressors is given by the population regression line
$$ E(Y_i\vert X_{1i}=x_1, X_{2i}=x_2,  X_{3i}=x_3,\dots, X_{ki}=x_k) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \dots + \beta_k x_k. $$
\item $\beta_0$ is the intercept; it is the expected value of $Y$ when all $X$s equal $0$. $\beta_j \ , \ j=1,\dots,k$ are the coefficients on $X_j \ , \ j=1,\dots,k$. $\beta_1$ measures the expected change in $Y_i$ that results from a one unit change in $X_{1i}$ while holding all other regressors constant. 
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

Key Concept 6.2 summarizes the core concepts of the multiple regression
model.

How can we estimate the coefficients of the multiple regression model
(6.4)? We will not go to much into detail on this issue as our focus
lies on usage of \texttt{R} instead of the technical details. However,
it should be pointed out that, similarly to the simple regression model,
the coefficients of the multiple regression model can be estimated using
OLS. As in the simple model, we seek to minimize the sum of squared
prediction mistakes by choosing estimates \(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_k\) for the
coefficients \(\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k\) such that

\[\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - b_0 - b_1 X_{1i} - b_2 X_{2i} - \dots -  b_k X_{ki})^2 \tag{6.5}\]

is minimized. Note that (6.5) is simply an extension of \(SSR\) in the
case with just one regressor and a constant. The estimators that
minimize (6.5) are hence denoted
\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\) and, as in the simple
regression model, we call them the ordinary least squares estimators of
\(\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k\). For the predicted value of \(Y_i\)
given the regressors and the estimates
\(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\) we have

\[ \hat{Y}_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_{1i} + \dots +\hat\beta_k X_{ki}. \]
The difference between \(Y_i\) and its predicted value \(\hat{Y}_i\) is
called the OLS residual of observation \(i\):
\(\hat{u} = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i\).

For further information regarding the theory behind multiple regression,
see Chapter 18.1 of the book which inter alia presents a derivation of
the OLS estimator in the multiple regression model using matrix
notation.

Now let us jump back to the example of test scores and class sizes. The
estimated model object is \texttt{mult.mod}. As for simple regression
models we can use \texttt{summary()} to obtain information on estimated
coefficients and model statistics.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(mult.mod)}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{coef}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##                Estimate Std. Error    t value      Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept) 686.0322445 7.41131160  92.565565 3.871327e-280
## STR          -1.1012956 0.38027827  -2.896026  3.978059e-03
## english      -0.6497768 0.03934254 -16.515882  1.657448e-47
\end{verbatim}

So the estimated multiple regression model is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = 686.03 - 1.10 \times STR - 0.65 \times PctEL \tag{6.6}.  \]

Unlike in the simple regression model where the data can be represented
by points in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, we are now
dealing with three dimensions. Hence observations can be represented by
points in the three-dimensional real space. Therefore (6.6) is now
longer a regression line but a \emph{regression plane}. This idea
extends to higher dimensions when we further expand the number of
regressors \(k\). We then say that the regression model can be
represented a hyperplane in the \(k+1\) dimensional space. It is already
hard to imagine such a space if \(k=3\) and we best stick with the
general idea that, in the multiple regression model, the dependent
variable is explained by a \emph{linear combination of the regressors}.
However, in the present case we are able to visualize the situation. The
following figure is an interactive 3D visualization of the data and the
estimated regression plane (6.6).

\begin{center}\textit{This interactive part of URFITE is only available in the HTML version.}\end{center}

We observe that the estimated regression plane fits the data reasonably
well --- at least with regard to the shape and spatial position of the
point cloud. The color of the markers is an indicator for the absolute
deviation from the predicted regression plane. Observations that are
colored more reddish lie close to the regression plane while the color
shifts to blue with growing distance. An anomaly that can be seen from
the plot is that there might be heteroskedasticity: we see that the
dispersion of regression errors made, i.e.~the distance of observations
to the regression plane shows a tendency to decrease as the share of
English learning students increases.

\section{Measures of Fit in Multiple Regression}\label{mofimr}

In multiple regression, common summary statistics are \(SER\), \(R^2\)
and the adjusted \(R^2\).

Taking the code from Section 6.3 You could simply use
\texttt{summary(mult.mod)} to obtain the \(SER\), \(R^2\) and
adjusted-\(R^2\). For multiple regression models the \(SER\) is computed
as

\[ SER = s_{\hat u} = \sqrt{s_{\hat u}^2} \] where, in contrast to the
simple regression model we apply a modification to the denominator of
the premultiplied factor in \(s_{\hat u}^2\) in order to accommodate for
additional regressors. Thus,

\[ s_{\hat u}^2 = \frac{1}{n-k-1} \, SSR \]

with \(k\) denoting the number of regressors \emph{excluding} the
intercept.

While \texttt{summary()} computes the \(R^2\) just as in the case of a
single regressor, it is no reliable measure for multiple regression
models. This is due to \(R^2\) becoming larger every time an additional
regressor is added to the model since adding a regressor decreases the
\(SSR\) --- at least unless the respective estimated coefficient is
exactly zero what practically never happens to be the case (see Chapter
6.4 of the book for a detailed argument). The adjusted \(R^2\) takes
this into consideration by ``punishing'' the addition of regressors
using a correction factor. So the adjusted \(R^2\), or simply
\(\overline{R^2}\), is a modified version of \(R^2\). It is defined as

\[ \overline{R^2} = 1-\frac{n-1}{n-k-1} \, \frac{SSR}{TSS}. \]

As you may have already suspected, \texttt{summary()} adjusts the
formula for \(SER\) and it computes \(\overline{R^2}\) and of course
\(R^2\) by default, thereby leaving the decision which measure to rely
on to the user.

You can find both measures at the bottom of the output produced by
calling \texttt{summary(mult.mod)}.

We find that the results do match. Now, what can be said about the fit
of our multiple regression model for test scores with the percentage of
English learners as an additional regressor? Does it improve on the
simple model including only an intercept and a measure of the class
size? The answer is yes: this is easily seen by comparing these measures
of fit with those obtained for the simple regression model \texttt{mod}.

Including \(PctEL\) as a regressor improves the \(R^2\) from about
\(5\%\) to \(42.6\%\). Qualitatively the same is observed for
\(\overline{R^2}\) which we deem to be more reliable in view of the
discussion above. Notice that the difference between \(R^2\) and
\(\overline{R^2}\) is small since \(k=2\) and \(n\) is large. In short,
the fit of (6.6) improves vastly on the fit of the simple regression
model with \(STR\) as the only regressor. Comparing regression errors we
find that the precision of the multiple regression model (6.6) improves
upon the simple model as adding \(PctEL\) lowers the \(SER\) from
\(18.6\) to \(14.5\) units of test score.

As already mentioned, \(R^2\) and \(\overline{R^2}\) may be used to
quantify how good a model fits the data. However it is rarely a good
idea to maximize these measures by stuffing the model with regressors.
You will not find any serious study that does so. Instead it is more
favorable to include regressors that improve the estimation of the
causal effect of interest which is \emph{not} assessed by means of a low
\(SSR\) of the model. The issue of variable selection is covered in
Chapter \ref{nrf} of this script and Chapter 7 in the book.

\section{OLS Assumptions in Multiple
Regression}\label{ols-assumptions-in-multiple-regression}

In the multiple regression model we extend the three least squares
assumptions imposed for the simple regression model (see Chapter
\ref{lrwor}) and add a fourth assumption. These assumptions are
presented in Key Concept 6.4. While we will not go into the details of
assumptions 1, 2 and 3 since their ideas have been discussed before and
are easily generalized to the case of multiple regressors, we will focus
on the fourth assumption. This forth assumption forbids the occurrence
of perfect correlation between the regressors.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Least Squares Assumptions in the Multiple Regression Model]{6.4}
The multiple regression model is given by

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_1 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + u_i \ , \ i=1,\dots,n. $$

The OLS assumptions in the multiple regression model are an extension of the ones made for the simple regression model:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Regressors $(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{ki}, Y_i) \ , \ i=1,\dots,n$ are drawn such that the i.i.d. assumption holds. 
\item $u_i$ is an error term with conditional mean zero given the regressors, i.e.
$$ E(u_i\vert X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{ki}) = 0. $$
\item Large outliers are unlikely, formally $X_{1i},\dots,X_{ki}$ and $Y_i$ have finite fourth moments.
\item No perfect multicollinearity.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{Multicollinearity}\label{multicollinearity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Multicollinearity}

If two or more regressors in a multiple regression model are
\emph{strongly} correlated we say that there is
\emph{multicollinearity}. If the correlation between two or more
regressors is perfect, that is, one regressor can be written as a linear
combination of the other(s), we refer to the situation as \emph{perfect
multicollinearity}. While strong multicollinearity in general is
unpleasant as it causes the variance of the OLS estimator to be large
(we will discuss is in more detail later), the presence of perfect
multicollinearity makes it impossible to solve for the OLS estimator,
i.e.~the model cannot be estimated in the first place.

The next section presents some examples of perfect multicollinearity and
demonstrates how R, specifically the function \texttt{lm()} deals with
them.

\subsubsection*{Examples of Perfect
Multicollinearity}\label{examples-of-perfect-multicollinearity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Examples of Perfect
Multicollinearity}

How does \texttt{R} react if we want it to estimate a model with
perfectly correlated regressors?

If we use the \texttt{lm} function to estimate a model with a set of
regressors that suffer from perfect multicollinearity, the system will
produce a warning in the first line of the coefficient section of the
output (\texttt{1 not defined because of singularities}) and ignore the
regressor(s) which is (are) assumed to be a linear combination of the
other(s). Consider the following example where we add another variable
\texttt{FracEL}, the fraction of English learners to \texttt{CASchools}
where observations are scaled values of the observations for
\texttt{english} and use it as a regressor together with \texttt{STR}
and \texttt{english} in a multiple regression model. In this example
\texttt{english} and \texttt{FracEL} are perfectly collinear. The
\texttt{R} code is as follows.

\end{verbatim}

Notice that the row \texttt{FracEL} in the coefficients section of the
output consists of \texttt{NA} entries since \texttt{FracEL} was
excluded from the model.

If we were to compute OLS by hand, we would run into the problem as well
but no one would be helping us out! The computation simply fails. Why is
this the case? Take the following example:

Assume you want to estimate a simple linear regression model with a
constant and a single regressor \(X\). As mentioned above, for perfect
multicollinearity to be present \(X\) has to be a linear combination of
the other regressors. Since the only other regressor is a constant
(think of the right hand side of the model equation as
\(\beta_0 \times 1 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i\) so that \(\beta_1\) is always
multiplied by \(1\) for every observation), \(X\) has to be constant as
well. For \(\hat\beta_1\) we have

\[ \hat{\beta_1} =  \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})} { \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2} = \frac{\widehat{cov}(X,Y)}{\widehat{Var}(X)}. \tag{6.7} \]

The variance of the regressor \(X\) stands in the denominator. Since the
variance of a constant is zero, we are not able to compute this fraction
and \(\hat{\beta}_1\) is undefined.

\textbf{Note:} In this special case the nominator in (6.7) equals zero,
too. Can You show that?

Let us consider two further examples where our selection of regressors
induces perfect multicollinearity. First, assume that we intend to
analyze the effect of class size on test score by using a dummy variable
that identifies classes which are not small (\(NS\)). We define that a
school has the \(NS\) attribute when the school's average
student-teacher ratio is at least \(12\),

\[ NS = \begin{cases} 0, \ \ \ \text{if STR < 12} \\ 1 \ \ \ \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} \]

We add the corresponding column to \texttt{CASchools} and estimate a
multiple regression model with covariates \texttt{computer} and
\texttt{english}.

\end{verbatim}

Again, the output of \texttt{summary(mult.mod)} tells us that inclusion
of \texttt{NS} in the regression would render the estimation infeasible.
What happened here? This is an example where we made a logical mistake
when defining the regressor \texttt{NS}: if we had taken a closer look
at \texttt{NS}, the redefined measure for class size, we would have
noticed that there is not a single school with \(STR<12\) hence \(NS\)
equals one for all observations. We can check this by printing the
contents of \texttt{CASchools\$NS} to the console or by using the
function \texttt{table()}, see \texttt{?table}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{table}\NormalTok{(CASchools}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{NS)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##   1 
## 420
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{CASchools\$NS} is a vector of \(420\) ones and our data set
includes \(420\) observations. This obviously violates assumption 4 of
Key Concept 6.4: remember that observations for the intercept are always
\(1\) so we have

\begin{align}
  intercept = \, & \lambda \cdot NS \\
  \\
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} = \, & \lambda \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\   \Leftrightarrow \, & \lambda = 1.
\end{align}

Since both regressors can be written as a linear combination of each
other, we face perfect multicollinearity and \texttt{R} excludes
\texttt{NS} from the model. Thus the message to take away is: think
carefully about how regressors you generated yourself could possibly
interact with unrecognized features of the data set!

Another example of perfect multicollinearity is known as the \emph{dummy
variable trap}. This may occur when multiple dummy variables are used as
regressors. A common case for this is when the dummies are used to sort
the data set into mutually exclusive categories. For example, suppose we
have spatial information that indicates whether a school is located in
the North, West, South or East of the U.S. which allows us to create the
dummy variables

\begin{align}
  North_i =& 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the north} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
  \\
    West_i =& 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the west} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
  \\
    South_i =& 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the south} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
    \\
    East_i =& 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \ \ \text{if located in the east} \\
    0 \ \ \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

Since the directions are mutually exclusive, for every school
\(i=1,\dots,n\) we have

\[ North_i + West_i + South_i + East_i = 1. \]

We run into problems when trying to estimate a model that includes a
constant and \emph{all four} direction dummies in the model, e.g.

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times STR + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_3 \times North_i + \beta_4 \times West_i + \beta_5 \times South_i + \beta_6 \times East_i + u_i \tag{6.8}\]
since then for all observations \(i=1,\dots,n\) the constant term can be
written as a linear combination of the dummies:

\begin{align}
  intercept = \, & \lambda_1 \cdot (North + West + South + East) \\
  \\
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} = \, & \lambda \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\   \Leftrightarrow \, & \lambda = 1
\end{align}

and we have perfect multicollinearity. This is what is meant by the
``dummy variable trap'': not paying attention and falsely including all
dummies \emph{and} a constant term in a regression model.

How does \texttt{lm()} handle a regression like (6.8)? To answer this we
first generate some artificial categorical data and append a new column
named \texttt{directions} to \texttt{CASchools} and see how
\texttt{lm()} behaves when asked to estimate the model.

Notice that \texttt{R} solves the problem sketched above on its own by
generating and including the dummies \texttt{directionNorth},
\texttt{directionSouth} and \texttt{directionWest} but omitting
\texttt{directionEast}. Of course, the omission of every other dummy
instead would achieve the same. This is done by default. Another
solution would be to exclude the constant and to include all dummies
instead.

Does this mean that the information on schools located in the East is
lost? Fortunately, this is not the case: exclusion of
\texttt{directEast} just alters the interpretation of coefficient
estimates on the remaining dummies from absolute to relative. For
example, the coefficient estimate on \texttt{directionNorth} states
that, on average, test scores in the North are about \(1.61\) points
higher than in the East.

A last example considers the case where a perfect linear relationship
arises from redundant regressors. Suppose we have a regressor \(PctES\),
the percentage of English speakers in the school where

\[ PctES = 100 -  PctEL\]

and both \(PctES\) and \(PctEL\) are both included in a regression
model. One regressor is redundant since the other one conveys the same
information. Since this obviously is a case where the regressors can be
written as linear combination, we end up with perfect multicollinearity,
again.

Let us do this in \texttt{R}.

Once more, \texttt{lm()} refuses to estimate the full model using OLS
and excludes \texttt{PctES}.

See Chapter 18.1 of the book for an explanation of perfect
multicollinearity and its consequences to the OLS estimator in general
multiple regression models using matrix notation.

\subsubsection*{Imperfect
Multicollinearity}\label{imperfect-multicollinearity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Imperfect Multicollinearity}

As opposed to perfect multicollinearity, imperfect multicollinearity is
--- to a certain extend --- not a problem. In fact, imperfect
multicollinearity is the reason why we are interested in estimating
multiple regression models in the first place: the OLS estimator allows
us to \emph{isolate} influences of \emph{correlated} regressors on the
dependent variable. If it was not for these dependencies, there would
not be a reason to resort to a multiple regression approach and we could
simply work with a single-regressor model. However, reality is
complicated and this is rarely the case. Moreover, we already know that
ignoring dependencies among regressors which influence the outcome
variable has an adverse effect on estimation results.

So when and why is imperfect multicollinearity a problem? Suppose you
have the regression model

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i \tag{6.9} \]

and you are interested in estimating \(\beta_1\), the effect on \(Y_i\)
of a one unit change in \(X_{1i}\), while holding \(X_{2i}\) constant.
You do not know that the true model indeed includes \(X_2\), but you
follow some reasoning and add \(X_2\) as a covariate to the model in
order to address a potential omitted variable bias. You are confident
that \(E(u_i\vert X_{1i}, X_{2i})=0\) for all observations and there is
no reason to suspect a violation of the assumptions 2 and 3 made in Key
Concept 6.4. If now \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are highly correlated, OLS has
its difficulties to estimate \(\beta_1\) precisely. That means although
\(\hat\beta_1\) is a consistent and unbiased estimator for \(\beta_1\),
it has a large variance due to \(X_2\) being included in the model. If
the errors are homoskedastic, this issue can be better understood from
inspecting the formula for the variance of \(\hat\beta_1\) in the model
(6.9) (see Appendix 6.2 of the book):

\[ \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \frac{1}{1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}} \right) \frac{\sigma^2_u}{\sigma^2_{X_1}}. \tag{6.10} \]

First, note that if \(\rho_{X_1,X_2}=0\), i.e.~if there is no
correlation between both regressors, including \(X_2\) in the model has
no influence on the variance of \(\hat\beta_1\). Secondly, if \(X_1\)
and \(X_2\) are correlated, \(\sigma^2_{\hat\beta_1}\) is inversely
proportional to \(1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}\) so the stronger the correlation
between \(X_1\) and \(X_2\), the smaller is \(1-\rho^2_{X_1,X_2}\) and
thus the bigger is the variance of \(\hat\beta_1\). Thirdly, increasing
the sample size helps to reduce the variance of \(\hat\beta_1\). Of
course, this is not limited to the case with two regressors: in general
multiple regression, imperfect multicollinearity inflates the variance
of one or more coefficient estimators and. It is an empirical question
which coefficient estimates are severely affected by this and which are
not. When the sample size is small in practice, one often faces the
decision whether to hazard the consequence of adding a large number of
covariates (higher variance) or to use a model with only few regressors
(possible omitted variable bias). This is called \emph{Model Selection}.

In sum, undesirable consequences of imperfect multicollinearity are
generally not the result of a logical error made by the researcher (as
is often the case for perfect multicollinearity) but are rather a
problem that is linked to the data used, the model to be estimated and
the research question at hand.

\subsection*{Simulation Study: Imperfect
Multicollinearity}\label{simulation-study-imperfect-multicollinearity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Simulation Study: Imperfect
Multicollinearity}

Let us conduct a simulation study to illustrate the issues sketched
above.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We use (6.9) as the data generating process and choose
  \(\beta_0 = 5\), \(\beta_1 = 2.5\) and \(\beta_2 = 3\) and \(u_i\) is
  an error term distributed as \(\mathcal{N}(0,5)\). In a first step, we
  sample the regressor data from a bivariate normal distribution:
  \[ X_i = (X_{1i}, X_{2i}) \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N} \left[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 2.5 \\ 2.5 & 10 \end{pmatrix} \right] \]
  It is straightforward to see that the correlation between \(X_1\) and
  \(X_2\) in the population is rather low:
\end{enumerate}

\[ \rho_{X_1,X_2} = \frac{Cov(X_1,X_2)}{\sqrt{Var(X_1)}\sqrt{Var{(X_2)}}} = \frac{2.5}{10} = 0.25 \]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Next, we estimate the model (6.9) and save the estimates for
  \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\). This is repeated \(10000\) times with a
  \texttt{for} loop so we end up with a large number of estimates that
  allow us to describe the distributions of \(\hat\beta_1\) and
  \(\hat\beta_2\).
\item
  We repeat steps 1 and 2 but increase the covariance between \(X_1\)
  and \(X_2\) from \(2.5\) to \(8.5\) such that the correlation between
  the regressors is high:
  \[ \rho_{X_1,X_2} = \frac{Cov(X_1,X_2)}{\sqrt{Var(X_1)}\sqrt{Var{(X_2)}}} = \frac{8.5}{10} = 0.85 \]
\item
  In order to assess the effect on the precision of the estimators of
  increasing the collinearity between \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) we estimate
  the variances of \(\hat\beta_1\) and \(\hat\beta_2\) and compare.

Since we call \texttt{var()} on matrices rather than vectors, the
outcomes are estimates of variance-covariance matrices. We are
interested in the variances which are the diagonal elements. We see that
due to the high collinearity, the variances of \(\hat\beta_1\) and
\(\hat\beta_2\) have more than tripled: in Econometrics lingo we say
that it has become more difficult to estimate the true coefficients
precisely.

\section{The Distribution of the OLS Estimators in Multiple
Regression}\label{the-distribution-of-the-ols-estimators-in-multiple-regression}

As in simple linear regression, different samples will produce different
values of the OLS estimators in the multiple regression model. Here
again this variation leads to uncertainty of those estimators and we
seek to describe it using their sampling distribution(s). In short, if
the assumption made in Key Concept 6.4 hold, the large sample
distribution of \(\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k\) is
multivariate normal and the individual estimators themselves are also
normally distributed. Key Concept 6.5 summarizes the corresponding
statements made in Chapter 6.6 of the book. A more technical derivation
of these results can be found in Chapter 18 of the book.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Large-sample distribution of $\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k$]{6.5}

If the least squares assumptions in the multiple regression model (see Key Concept 6.4) hold, then in large samples, the OLS estimators $\hat\beta_0,\hat\beta_1,\dots,\hat\beta_k$ are jointly normally distributed. We also say that their joint distribution is \textit{multivariate} normal. Further, each $\hat\beta_j$ is distributed as $N(\beta_j,\sigma_{\beta_j}^2)$.

\end{keyconcepts}

Essentially, Key Concept 6.5 states that, if the sample size is large,
we can approximate the individual sampling distributions of the
coefficient estimators by specific normal distributions and their joint
sampling distribution by a multivariate normal distribution.

How can we use \texttt{R} to get an idea of what the joint PDF of the
coefficient estimators in multiple regression model looks like? When
estimating some model on arbitrary data once, we would end up with a set
of point estimates that do not reveal much information on the joint
density of the estimators. However, with a large number of estimations
using repeatedly randomly sampled data from the same population we could
generate a large set of point estimates that allows us to plot an
\emph{estimate} of the joint density function.

The approach we will use to do this in \texttt{R} is a follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Generate \(10000\) random samples of size \(50\) using the DGP
\end{itemize}

\[ Y_i = 5 + 2.5 \cdot X_{1i} + 3 \cdot X_{2i} + u_i  \]

where the regressors \(X_{1i}\) and \(X_{2i}\) are sampled for each
observations as

\[ X_i = (X_{1i}, X_{2i}) \sim \mathcal{N} \left[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 2.5 \\ 2.5 & 10 \end{pmatrix} \right] \]

and

\[ u_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,5) \]

is an error term.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For each of the \(10000\) simulated sets of sample data, we estimate
  the model
\end{itemize}

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i \] and save the
coefficient estimates \(\hat\beta_1\) and \(\hat\beta_2\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We compute a density estimate of the joint distribution of
  \(\hat\beta_1\) and \(\hat\beta_2\) in the model above using the
  function \texttt{kde2d()} from the package \texttt{MASS}, see
  \texttt{?MASS}. This estimate is then plotted using the function
  \texttt{persp()}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-263-1} \end{center}

From the plot above we can see that the density estimate has some
similarity to a bivariate normal distribution (see Chapter \ref{pt})
though it is not very pretty and probably a little rough. Furthermore,
there is a correlation between the estimates such that \(\rho\neq0\) in
(2.1). Also, the distribution's shape deviates from the symmetric bell
shape of the bivariate standard normal distribution and has an
elliptical surface area instead.

\end{verbatim}

Where does this correlation come from? Notice that, due to the way we
generated the data, there is correlation between the regressors \(X_1\)
and \(X_2\). Correlation between the regressors in a multiple regression
model always translates to correlation between the estimators (see
Appendix 6.2 of the book). In our case, the positive correlation between
\(X_1\) and \(X_2\) translates to negative correlation between
\(\hat\beta_1\) and \(\hat\beta_2\). To get a better idea of the
distribution you can vary the point of view in the subsequent smooth
interactive 3D plot of the same density estimate used for plotting with
\texttt{persp()}. Here you can see that the shape of the distribution is
somewhat stretched due to \(\hat\rho=-0.20\) and it is also apparent
that both estimators are unbiased since their joint density seems to be
centered close to the true parameter vector
\((\beta_1,\beta_2) = (2.5,3)\).

\chapter{Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals in Multiple
Regression}\label{htaciimr}

This chapter discusses methods that allow to quantify the sampling
uncertainty inherent to the OLS estimator of the coefficients in
multiple regression models. The basis for this are hypothesis tests and
confidence intervals which, just as for the simple linear regression
model, can be computed using basic \texttt{R} functions. We will also
tackle the issue of testing joint hypotheses on these coefficients.

Make sure the packages \texttt{AER} \citep{R-AER} and \texttt{stargazer}
\citep{R-stargazer} are installed before you go ahead and replicate the
examples. The safest way to do so is by checking whether the following
code chunk executes without any issues.

\section{Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals for a Single
Coefficient}\label{hypothesis-tests-and-confidence-intervals-for-a-single-coefficient}

First, we will discuss how to compute standard errors, how to test
hypotheses and how to construct confidence intervals for a single
regression coefficient \(\beta_j\) in a multiple regression model. The
basic idea is summarized in Key Concept 7.1.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Testing the Hypothesis $\beta_j = \beta_{j,0}$
                    Against the Alternative $\beta_j \neq \beta_{j,0}$]{7.1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the standard error of $\hat{\beta_j}$
\item Compute the $t$-statistic,
$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_j - \beta_{j,0}} {SE(\hat{\beta_j})}$$
\item Compute the $p$-value,
$$p\text{-value} = 2 \Phi(-|t^{act}|)$$
where $t^{act}$ is the value of the $t$-statistic actually computed. Reject the hypothesis at the 5\% significance level if the $p$-value is less than $0.05$ or, equivalently, if $|t^{act}| > 1.96$. \end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

The standard error and (typically) the $t$-statistic and the corresponding $p$-value for testing $\beta_j = 0$ are computed automatically by suitable \texttt{R} functions, e.g. by \texttt{summary()}.
\end{keyconcepts}

It is straightforward to verify that principles of testing a single
hypothesis about the significance of a coefficient in the multiple
regression model is just as in in the simple regression model.

You can easily see this by inspecting the coefficient summary of the
regression model

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 - \beta_1 \times size - \beta_2 \times english + u \]

already discussed in Chapter \ref{rmwmr}. Let us review this:

You may check that these quantities are computed as in the simple
regression model by computing the \(t\)-statistics or \(p\)-values by
hand using the output above and \texttt{R} as a calculator.

For example, using the definition of the \(p\)-value for a two-sided
test as given in Key Concept 7.1, we can confirm the \(p\)-value for a
test of the hypothesis that the coefficient \(\beta_0\), the coefficient
on \texttt{(intercept)}, to be approximately zero.

Remember that, given a vector of quantiles, \texttt{pnorm()} calculates
the associated probabilities for the standard normal distribution by
default which is suitable here since we approximate with the standard
normal distribution.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Confidence Intervals for a Single Coefficient in Multiple Regression]{7.2}
A $95\%$ two-sided confidence interval for the coefficient $\beta_j$ is an interval that contains the true value of $\beta_j$ with a $95 \%$ probability; that is, it contains the true value of $\beta_j$ in $95 \%$ of all randomly drawn samples. Equivalently, it is the set of values of $\beta_j$ that cannot be rejected by a $5 \%$ two-sided hypothesis test. When the sample size is large, the $95 \%$ confidence interval for $\beta_j$ is
$$\left[\hat{\beta_j}- 1.96 \times SE(\hat{\beta}_j), \hat{\beta_j} + 1.96 \times SE(\hat{\beta_j})\right].$$
\end{keyconcepts}

\section{An Application to Test Scores and the Student-Teacher
Ratio}\label{an-application-to-test-scores-and-the-student-teacher-ratio}

Let us take a look at the regression from section 6.3 again.

Computing confidence intervals for the individual coefficients in the
multiple regression model can be done analogously as in the simple
regression model using the function \texttt{confint()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(score }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{size }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{english, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ CASchools)}
\KeywordTok{confint}\NormalTok{(model)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##                   2.5 %      97.5 %
## (Intercept) 671.4640580 700.6004311
## size         -1.8487969  -0.3537944
## english      -0.7271113  -0.5724424
\end{verbatim}

Notice that \(95\%\) confidence intervals for all three coefficients are
computed.

If we want to compute confidence intervals at another level, say
\(\alpha=0.1\), we just have to set the argument \texttt{level} in our
call of \texttt{confint()} accordingly.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{confint}\NormalTok{(model, }\DataTypeTok{level =} \FloatTok{0.9}\NormalTok{)}

## english      -0.7146336  -0.5849200
\end{verbatim}

The output now reports the desired \(90\%\) confidence intervals for all
model coefficients.

A disadvantage of `r ttcode(``confint()'') is that is does not use
robust standard errors to compute the confidence interval. This is
quickly done manually as follows.

\end{verbatim}

Knowing how to use \texttt{R} to make inference about the coefficients
in multiple regression models, you can now answer the following
question:

Can the null hypothesis that a change in the student-teacher ratio,
\texttt{size}, has no significant influence on test scores,
\texttt{scores}, --- if we control for the percentage of students
learning English in the district, \texttt{english}, --- be rejected at
the \(10\%\) and the \(5\%\) level of significance?

From the output above we can tell that zero is not an element of the
computed confidence intervals for the coefficient on \texttt{size} such
that we can reject the null hypothesis at significance levels of \(5\%\)
and \(10\%\).

Note that rejection at the \(5\%\)-level implies rejection at the
\(10\%\) level (why?).

The same conclusion can be made when beholding the \(p\)-value for
\texttt{size}: \(0.00398 < 0.05 = \alpha\).

Remember from Chapter \ref{cifrc} the \(95\%\) confidence interval
computed above \emph{does not} tell us that a one-unit decrease in the
student-teacher ratio has an effect on test scores that lies in the
interval with a lower bound of \(-1.9497\) and an upper bound of
\(-0.2529\). Once a confidence interval has been computed, a
probabilistic statement like this is wrong: either the interval contains
the true parameter or it does not. We do not know which is true.

\subsection*{Another Augmentation of the
Model}\label{another-augmentation-of-the-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Another Augmentation of the Model}

What is the average effect on test scores of reducing the
student-teacher ratio when the expenditures per pupil and the percentage
of english learning pupils are held constant?

We can pursue this question by augmenting our model equation by an
additional regressor that is a measure for spendings per pupil. Using
\texttt{?CASchools} we find that \texttt{CASchools} contains the
variable \texttt{expenditure} which provides expenditures per student.

The model we want the estimate now is

\[ TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_3 \times expenditure + u \]

with \(expenditure\) the total amount of expenditures per pupil in the
district (thousands of dollars).

Let us now estimate the model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Scale expenditure to thousands of dollars}
\NormalTok{CASchools}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{expenditure <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{CASchools}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{expenditure}\OperatorTok{/}\DecValTok{1000}

\CommentTok{# estimate the model}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## t test of coefficients:

##               Estimate Std. Error  t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept) 649.577947  15.458344  42.0212  < 2e-16 ***

## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
\end{verbatim}

We see that the estimated effect of a one unit change in the
student-teacher ratio on test scores with expenditures per pupil and the
share of english learning pupils held constant is \(-0.29\) which is
rather small. What is more, the coefficient on \(size\) is not
significantly different from zero anymore even at the level of \(10\%\)
since \(p\text{-value}=0.55\). Can you come up with an interpretation
for these findings (see Chapter 7.1 of the book)? The insignificance of
\(\beta_1\) could be due to a larger standard error of \(\hat{\beta}_1\)
resulting from adding \(expenditure\) to the model so that we are
estimating the true coefficient on \(size\) less precisely. This
illustrates the issue of strongly correlated regressors (imperfect
multicollinearity). The correlation between \(size\) and \(expenditure\)
can be computed using \texttt{cor()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# compute the sample correlation between 'size' and 'expenditure'}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] -0.6199822
\end{verbatim}

Altogether we conclude that the new model provides no evidence that
changing the student-teacher ratio, e.g.~by hiring new teachers, has any
effect on the test scores while keeping expenditures per student and the
share of English learners constant at the same time.

\section{Joint Hypothesis Testing Using the
F-Statistic}\label{joint-hypothesis-testing-using-the-f-statistic}

The estimated model is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(15.21)}{649.58} -\underset{(0.48)}{0.29} \times size - \underset{(0.04)}{0.66} \times english + \underset{(1.41)}{3.87} \times expenditure. \]

Now, can we reject the hypothesis that the coefficient on \(size\)
\emph{and} the coefficient on \(expenditure\) are zero? To answer this
question, we have to resort to methods that allow joint hypothesis
testing. A joint hypothesis imposes restrictions on multiple regression
coefficients. This is different from conducting individual \(t\)-tests
where a restriction is imposed on a single coefficient. Chapter 7.2 of
the book explains why testing hypotheses about the model coefficients
one at a time is different from testing them jointly.

The homoskedasticity-only \(F\)-Statistic is given by

\[ F = \frac{(SSR_{restricted} - SSR_{unrestricted})/q}{SSR_{unrestricted} / (n-k_{unrestricted}-1)} \]

with \(SSR_{restricted}\) being the sum of squared residuals from the
restricted regression, i.e.~the regression where we impose the
restriction. \(SSR_{unrestricted}\) is the sum of squared residuals from
the full model, \(q\) is the number of restriction under the null and
\(k\) is the number of regressors in the unrestricted regression.

Luckily, it is fairly easy to conduct \(F\)-tests in \texttt{R}. We can
use the function \texttt{linearHypothesis()} which is contained in the
package \texttt{car}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
\end{verbatim}

From the output we can infer that the \(F\)-statistic for this joint
hypothesis test is about \(8.01\) and the corresponding \(p\)-value is
\(0.0004\). Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that both
coefficients are zero at any level of significance commonly used in
practice.

A heteroskedasticity-robust version of this \(F\)-test (which leads to
the same conclusion) can be conducted as follows.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Note:} The standard output of a model summary also reports an
\(F\)-statistic and the corresponding \(p\)-value. The null hypothesis
belonging to this \(F\)-test is that \textbf{all} of the population
coefficients in the model except for the intercept are zero, so the
hypotheses pair is

\[H_0: \beta_1=0, \ \beta_2 =0, \ \beta_3 =0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \beta_j \neq 0 \ \text{for at least one} \ j=1,2,3.\]

This is also called the \emph{overall regression \(F\)-statistic} and
the null hypothesis is obviously different from testing if only
\(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_3\) being zero.

We will now check whether the \(F\)-statistic belonging to the
\(p\)-value listed in the model's summary coincides with the result
reported by \texttt{linearHypothesis()}.

The test rejects the null hypothesis that the model has no power in
explaining test scores. It is important to know that the \(F\)-statistic
reported by \texttt{summary} is \emph{not} robust to heteroskedasticity!

\section{Confidence Sets for Multiple
Coefficients}\label{confidence-sets-for-multiple-coefficients}

Based on the \(F\)-statistic that we have previously encountered, we can
specify confidence sets. Confidence sets are analogous to confidence
intervals for single coefficients. As such, confidence sets consist of
\emph{combinations} of coefficients that contain the true combination of
coefficients in, \(95\%\) say, of all cases if we could draw random
samples infinitely, just like in the univariate case. Put differently, a
confidence set is the set of all coefficient combinations for which we
cannot reject a joint null hypothesis tested using an \(F\)-test.

If we consider two coefficients, their confidence set is an ellipse
which is centered around the point defined by both coefficient
estimates. Again, there is a very convenient way to plot the confidence
set for two coefficients of model objects, namely the function
\texttt{confidenceEllipse()} which is also coming with the \texttt{car}
package.

In the following, we plot the \(95\%\) confidence ellipse for the
coefficients on \texttt{size} and \texttt{expenditure} from the
regression conducted above. By specifying the additional argument
\texttt{fill}, the confidence set is colored.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Draw the 95% confidence set for coefficients on size and expenditure}
\KeywordTok{confidenceEllipse}\NormalTok{(model, }
                  \DataTypeTok{fill =}\NormalTok{ T, }
                  \DataTypeTok{which.coef =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"size"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"expenditure"}\NormalTok{),}
                  \DataTypeTok{main =} \StringTok{"95% Confidence Set"}
\NormalTok{                  )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-287-1} \end{center}

We see that the ellipse is centered around \((-0.29, 3.87)\), the pair
of coefficients estimates on \(size\) and \(expenditure\). What is more,
\((0,0)\) is not element of the \(95\%\) confidence set so that we can
reject \(H_0: \beta_1 = 0, \ \beta_3 = 0\).

By default, \texttt{confidenceEllipse()} uses homoskedasticity-only
standard errors. The following code chunk shows how compute a robust
confidence ellipse and how to overlay it with the previous plot.

\begin{Highlighting}[]

                  \DataTypeTok{add =}\NormalTok{ T}
\NormalTok{                  )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-288-1} \end{center}

Notice that since the robust standard errors are slightly larger than
those valid under homoskedasticity only in this case, the robust
confidence set is slightly larger. This is analogous to the confidence
intervals for the individual coefficients.

\section{Model Specification for Multiple
Regression}\label{model-specification-for-multiple-regression}

Choosing a regression specification, i.e.~selecting the variables to be
included in a regression model, can be quite cumbersome. However, there
are some guidelines on how to proceed. The goal is clear: obtaining an
unbiased and precise estimate of the causal effect of interest. As a
starting point, one should think about omitted variables, that is, to
avoid a possible estimation bias by using suitable control variables
(omitted variables bias in the context of multiple regression is
explained in Key Concept 7.3). A second step could be to compare
different regression model specifications by measures of fit. However,
as we shall see one should not rely solely on \(\overline{R^2}\).

\begin{keyconcepts}[Omitted Variable Bias in Multiple Regression]{7.3}
Omitted variable bias is the bias in the OLS estimator that arises when regressors correlate with an omitted variable. For omitted variable bias to arise, two things must be true:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item At least one of the included regressors must be correlated with the omitted variable. 
\item The omitted variable must be a determinant of the dependent variable, $Y$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{keyconcepts}

We will now discuss an example were we face a potential omitted variable
bias in a multiple regression model:

Consider again the estimated regression equation

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(8.7)}{686.0} - \underset{(0.43)}{1.10} \times size - \underset{(0.031)}{0.650} \times english. \]

We are interested in estimating the causal effect of class size on test
score. In this estimation, there might be a bias due to omitting
``outside learning opportunities'' from our regression since a measure
like this could be a determinant of the students test scores and could
also be correlated with both regressors already included in the model
(so that both conditions of Key Concept 7.3 are fulfilled). ``outside
learning opportunities'' are a complicated concept that is difficult to
quantify. A surrogate we can consider instead is the students' economic
background which should be strongly related to the outside learning
opportunities: think of wealthy parents that are able to provide time
and/or money for private tuition of their children. We thus augment the
model with the variable \texttt{lunch}, the percentage of students that
qualify for a free or subsidized lunch in school due to family incomes
below a certain threshold, and estimate the model again.

Thus, the estimated regression line is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(5.56)}{700.15} - \underset{(0.27)}{1.00} \times size - \underset{(0.03)}{0.12} \times english - \underset{(0.02)}{0.55} \times lunch. \]

We observe no substantial changes in the conclusion about the effect of
\(size\) on \(TestScore\): the coefficient on \(size\) changes by only
\(0.1\) and keeps its significance.

Although the difference in estimated coefficients is not big in this
case, it might be a good idea to keep \texttt{lunch} in the model to
make the assumption of conditional mean independence more credible (see
Chapter 7.5 of the book).

\subsection*{Model Specification in Theory and in
Practice}\label{model-specification-in-theory-and-in-practice}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Model Specification in Theory and in
Practice}

Key Concept 7.4 names some common pitfalls when using \(R^2\) and
\(\overline{R^2}\) to evaluate the predictive ability of regression
models.

\begin{keyconcepts}[$R^2$ and $\overline{R^2}$: What They Tell You --- and What They Do not]{7.4}
The $R^2$ and $\overline{R^2}$ tell you whether the regressors are good at explaining the variation of the independent variable in the sample of data. If the $R^2$ (or $\overline{R^2}$) is nearly $1$, then the regressors produce a good prediction of the dependent variable in that sample, in the sense that the variance of OLS residuals is small compared to the variance of the dependent variable. If the $R^2$ (or $\overline{R^2}$) is nearly $0$, the opposite is true.\newline

The $R^2$ and $\overline{R^2}$ do \textit{not} tell you whether:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item An included variable is statistically significant. 
\item The regressors are the true cause of the movements in the dependent variable
\item There is omitted variable bias.
\item You have chosen the most appropriate set of regressors.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

For example, think of regressing \(TestScore\) on \(PLS\) which measures
the available parking lot space in thousand square feet. You are likely
to observe a significant coefficient of reasonable magnitude and
moderate to high values for \(R^2\) and \(\overline{R^2}\). The reason
for this is that parking lot space is correlated with many determinants
of the test score like location, class size, financial endowment and so
on. Although we do not have observations on \(PLS\), we can use
\texttt{R} to generate some relatively realistic data.

\end{verbatim}

\(PLS\) is generated as a linear function of \(expenditure\),
\(income\), \(size\) and a random disturbance. Therefore the data
suggest that there is some positive relationship between parking lot
space and test score. In fact, when estimating the model

\begin{align}
TestScore = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times PLS + u \label{eq:plsmod} 
\end{align}

using \texttt{lm()} we find that the coefficient on \(PLS\) is positive
and significantly different from zero. Also \(R^2\) and
\(\overline{R^2}\) are about \(0.47\) which is a lot more than the
roughly \(0.05\) observed when regressing the test scores on the class
sizes only. This suggests that increasing the parking lot space boosts a
school's test scores and that model \eqref{eq:plsmod} does even better in
explaining heterogeneity in the dependent variable than a model with
\(size\) as the only regressor. Keeping in mind how \(PLS\) is
constructed this comes of no surprise. It is evident that the high
\(R^2\) cannot be used to the conclude that the estimated relation
between parking lot space and test scores is causal: the (relatively)
high \(R^2\) is due to correlation between \(PLS\) and other
determinants and/or control variables. Increasing parking lot space is
not an appropriate measure to generate more learning success!

\section{Analysis of the Test Score Data
Set}\label{analysis-of-the-test-score-data-set}

Chapter \ref{rmwmr} and some of the previous sections have stressed that
it is important to include control variables in regression models if it
is plausible that there are omitted factors that cannot be measured
directly. Recall that in our example of test scores we are interested in
estimating the causal effect of a change in the student-teacher ratio on
test scores. In what follows, we will provide an example how to use
multiple regression models in order to alleviate omitted variable bias
and we will demonstrate how to report results using \texttt{R}.

So far we have considered two variables that control for unobservable
student characteristics which correlate with the student-teacher ratio
\emph{and} are assumed to have an impact on test scores:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(English\), the percentage of English learning students
\item
  \(lunch\), the share of students that qualify for a subsidized or even
  a free lunch at school
\end{itemize}

Another new variable provided with \texttt{CASchools} is
\texttt{calworks}, the percentage of students that qualify for the
\emph{CalWorks} income assistance program. Students eligible for
\emph{CalWorks} live in families with a total income below the threshold
for the subsidized lunch program so both variables are indicators for
the share of economically disadvantaged children. Using \texttt{R} we
can confirm that both indicators are highly correlated:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# estimate the correlation between 'calworks' and 'lunch'}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.7394218
\end{verbatim}

There is no unambiguous way to proceed when deciding which variable to
use. In any case it is not a good idea to use both variables as
regressors having in mind consequences of collinearity. Therefore, we
will also consider alternative model specifications.

For a start, we plot student characteristics against test scores.

We will consider \(5\) different model equations:

\begin{align*}
  (I) \quad TestScore=& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + u \\
  (II) \quad TestScore=& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + \beta_2 \times english + u \\
  (III) \quad TestScore=& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_3 \times lunch + u \\
  (IV) \quad TestScore=& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_4 \times calworks + u \\
  (V) \quad TestScore=& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size + \beta_2 \times english + \beta_3 \times lunch + \beta_4 \times calworks + u
\end{align*}

The best way to communicate regression results is in a table. The
\texttt{stargazer} package is very convenient for this purpose. It
provides a function that generates professionally looking HTML and LaTeX
tables that satisfy scientific standards. One simply has to provide one
or multiple object(s) of class \texttt{lm} and the rest is done by the
function \texttt{stargazer()}.

Table \ref{tab:rotsostracv} states that \(scores\) is the dependent
variable and that we consider five models. We see that the columns of
Table \ref{tab:rotsostracv} contain most of the information provided by
\texttt{coeftest()} and \texttt{summary()} for the regression models
under consideration: the coefficient section of the table presents
coefficients estimates equipped with significance codes (the asterisks)
and standard errors in parentheses below. Although there are no
\(t\)-statistics, it is straightforward for the reader to compute them
simply by dividing a coefficient estimate by the corresponding standard
error. At the bottom of the table we find summary statistics for each
model and a legend. For an in-depth discussion of the tabular
presentation of regression results, see Chapter 7.6 of the book.

What can we conclude from the model comparison?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We see that adding control variables roughly halves the coefficient on
  \texttt{size}. Also the estimate is not very sensitive to the set of
  control variables used. The conclusion is that decreasing the
  student-teacher ratio ceteris paribus by one unit leads to an
  estimated average increase in test scores of about \(1\) point.
\item
  Adding student characteristics as controls boosts \(R^2\) and
  \(\overline{R^2}\) from \(0.049\) (\texttt{spec1}) up to \(0.773\)
  (\texttt{spec3} and \texttt{spec5}), so we can consider these
  variables as suitable predictors for test scores. Moreover, the
  estimated coefficients on all control variables are consistent with
  the impressions gained from Figure 7.2 of the book.
\item
  We see that the control variables are not statistically significant in
  all models. For example in \texttt{spec5} we see that the coefficient
  on \(calworks\) is not significantly different from zero at the level
  of \(5\%\) since \(\lvert-0.048/0.059\rvert=0.81 < 1.64\). We also
  observe that the effect on the estimate (and its standard error) of
  the coefficient on \(size\) of adding \(calworks\) to the base
  specification \texttt{spec3} is negligible. We can therefore consider
  \texttt{calworks} as a redundant control variable in this model.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Nonlinear Regression Functions}\label{nrf}

Until now we assumed the regression function to be linear, i.e.~we have
treated the slope parameter of the regression function as a constant.
This implies that the effect on \(Y\) of a one unit change in \(X\) does
not depend on the level of \(X\). If however the effect of a change in
\(X\) on \(Y\) does depend on the value of \(X\), we have to model the
relationship using a nonlinear regression function.

Just like for the previous chapter, the packages AER \citep{R-AER} and
stargazer \citep{R-stargazer} are required for reproduction of the code
presented in this chapter. Check whether the code chunk below executes
without any error messages.

\section{A General Strategy for Modelling Nonlinear Regression
Functions}\label{a-general-strategy-for-modelling-nonlinear-regression-functions}

Let us have a look at an example where in fact using a nonlinear
regression function is better suited for the estimation of the
population relationship between the regressor, \(X\), and the
regressand, \(Y\): the relationship between the income of schooling
districts and their test scores.

\end{verbatim}

The correlation coefficient is about \(0.71\). This means that income
and test scores are positively correlated. In other words, children
whose parents have an above average income tend to achieve above average
test scores. Can we use the correlation coefficient to assess whether a
linear regression model does fit the data adequately? To answer this
question we visualize the data and add a linear regression line to the
plot.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-310-1} \end{center}

As pointed out in the book, the linear regression line seems to
overestimate the true relationship when income is very high or very low
and underestimates it for the middle income group.

Fortunately, usage of the OLS estimator is not restricted to linear
functions of the regressors. Thus we can for example model test scores
as a function of income and the square of income. The corresponding
regression model is

\[TestScore_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 income_i + \beta_2 income_i^2 + u_i.\]

This equation is called the \emph{quadratic regression model}. Note,
that \(income^2\) is treated as an additional explanatory variable.
Hence, the quadratic model is a special case of a multivariate
regression model. When fitting the model with lm() we have to use the
\^{} operator in conjunction with the function I() to add the quadratic
term as an additional regressor to the argument formula.

The output tells us that the estimated regression function is

\[\widehat{TestScore}_i = \underset{(2.90)}{607.3} + \underset{(0.)}{3.85} \times income_i - \underset{(0.0048)}{0.0423} \times income_i^2.\]

Notice that this estimated model equation allows us to test the
hypothesis that the relationship between test scores and district income
is linear against the alternative hypothesis that it is quadratic. This
corresponds to testing

\[H_0: \beta_2 = 0 \ \ \text{vs.} \ \  H_1: \beta_2\neq0,\]

since \(\beta_2=0\) corresponds to a simple linear equation and
\(\beta_2\neq0\) implies a quadratic relationship. We find that
\(t=(\hat\beta_2 - 0)/SE(\hat\beta_2) = -0.0423/0.0048 = -8.81\) so the
null is rejected at any common level of significance and we conclude
that the relationship is nonlinear. This is consistent with the
impression gained from inspection of the plotted data.

We can now draw the same scatter plot as for the linear model and add
the regression line for the quadratic model. Because abline() can only
draw straight lines, it cannot be used for this task. A function which
can be used to draw lines without being restricted to straight lines is
lines(), see \texttt{?lines}. The most basic call of lines() is
lines(x\_values, y\_values) where x\_values and y\_values are vectors of
the same length that provide coordinates of the points to be
\emph{sequentially} connected by a line. This makes it necessary to sort
the coordinate pairs according to the X-values. Otherwise you will not
get the desired result! In this example we use the function order() to
sort the fitted values of score according to the observations of income.

\section{Nonlinear Functions of a Single Independent
Variable}\label{nfoasiv}

\subsection*{Polynomials}\label{polynomials}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Polynomials}

The approach used to obtain a quadratic model can be generalized to
polynomial models of arbitrary degree \(r\).
\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 X_i^2 + \ldots + \beta_r X_i^r + u_i\]

A cubic model (\(r=3\)) for instance can be estimated in the same way as
the quadratic model; we just have to add I(income\^{}3) to the formula
argument in our call of lm().

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cubic_model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(score }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{income }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{I}\NormalTok{(income}\OperatorTok{^}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{I}\NormalTok{(income}\OperatorTok{^}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ CASchools)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In practice the question will arise which polynomial order should be
chosen. First note that, similarly as for \(r=2\), we can test the null
hypothesis that the true relation is linear against the alternative
hypothesis that the relationship is a polynomial of degree \(r\):

\[ H_0: \beta_2=0, \ \beta_3=0,\dots,\beta_r=0 \ \ \ \text{vs.} \ \ \ H_1: \text{at least one} \ \beta_j\neq0, \ j=2,\dots,r \]

This is a joint null hypothesis with \(r-1\) restrictions so it can be
tested using the \(F\)-test presented in Chapter \ref{htaciimr}.
Remember that the function linearHypothesis() can used to conduct such
tests. If, for example, we would like to test the null hypothesis of a
linear model against the alternative of a polynomial of a maximal degree
\(r=3\), we could simply do the following:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

The \(p\)-value for this test is very small so that we reject the null
hypothesis. However, this does not tell us \emph{which} \(r\) to choose.
In practice, one approach to determine the degree of the polynomial is
to use \emph{sequential testing}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate a polynomial model for some maximum value \(r\).
\item
  Use a \(t\)-test to test whether \(\beta_r = 0\). Rejection of the
  null means that \(X^r\) belongs in the regression equation.
\item
  Acceptance of the null in step 2 means that \(X^r\) can be eliminated
  from the model. Continue by repeating step 1 with order \(r-1\) and
  test whether \(\beta_{r-1}=0\). If the test rejects, use a polynomial
  model of order \(r-1\).
\item
  If the tests from step 3 rejects, continue with the procedure until
  the coefficient on the highest power is statistically significant.
\end{enumerate}

There is no unambiguous guideline how to choose \(r\) in step one.
However, as pointed out in \citet{stock2015}, economic data is often
smooth such that it is appropriate to choose small orders like \(2\),
\(3\), or \(4\).

We will now demonstrate how to apply sequential testing by the example
of the cubic model.

The estimated cubic model stored in cubic\_model is

From the output we can tell that the \(t\)-statistic on \(income^3\) is
\(1.42\) so the null that the relationship is quadratic cannot be
rejected, even at the \(10\%\) level. This is contrary to the result
presented book which reports robust standard errors throughout so we
will also use robust variance-covariance estimation to reproduce these
results.

\subsubsection*{Interpretation of Coefficients in Nonlinear Regression
Models}\label{interpretation-of-coefficients-in-nonlinear-regression-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Interpretation of Coefficients in
Nonlinear Regression Models}

The coefficients in polynomial regression models do not have a simple
interpretation. Why is that? Think of a quadratic model: it is not
helpful to think of the coefficient on \(X\) as the expected change in
\(Y\) associated with a change in \(X\) holding the other regressors
constant because one other is \(X^2\) which changes as \(X\) is varied.
This is also the case for other deviations from linearity, for example
in models where regressors and/or the dependent variable are
log-transformed. The best way to approach this is to calculate the
estimated effect on \(Y\) associated with a change in \(X\) for one or
more values of \(X\). This idea is summarized in Key Concept 8.1.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Expected Effect on $Y$ of a Change in $X_1$ in a Nonlinear Regression Model]{8.1}
Consider the nonlinear population regression model

$$ Y_i = f(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{ki}) + u_i \ , \ i=1,\dots,n,$$

where $f(X_{1i}, X_{2i}, \dots, X_{ki})$ is the population regression function and $u_i$ is the error term.

Denote $\Delta Y$ the expected change in $Y$ associated with $\Delta X_1$, the change in $X_1$ while holding $X_2, \cdots , X_k$ constant. That is, the expected change in $Y$ is the difference

$$\Delta Y = f(X_1 + \Delta X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_k) - f(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_k).$$

The estimator of this unknown population difference is the difference between the predicted values for these two cases. Let $\hat{f}(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_k)$ be the predicted value of of $Y$ based on the estimator $\hat{f}$ of the population regression function. Then the predicted change in $Y$ is

$$\Delta \widehat{Y} = \hat{f}(X_1 + \Delta X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_k) - \hat{f}(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_k).$$
\end{keyconcepts}

For example, we may ask the following: what is the predicted change in
test scores associated with a one unit change (i.e. \(\$1000\)) in
income, based on the estimated quadratic regression function

\[\widehat{TestScore} = 607.3 + 3.85 \times income - 0.0423 \times income^2\ ?\]

Because the regression function is quadratic, this effect depends on the
initial district income. We therefore consider two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  An increase in district income form \(10\) to \(11\) (i.e.~from
  \(\$10000\) per capita to \(\$11000\))
\item
  An increase in district income from \(40\) to \(41\) (that is from
  \(\$40000\) to \(\$41000\)).
\end{enumerate}

In order to obtain the \(\Delta \widehat{Y}\) associated with a change
in income form \(10\) to \(11\), we use the following formula:

\[\Delta \widehat{Y} = \left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times 11 + \hat{\beta}_2 \times 11^2\right) - \left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times 10 + \hat{\beta}_2 \times 10^2\right) \]
To compute \(\widehat{Y}\) using R we may use predict().

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##        2 
## 2.962517
\end{verbatim}

Analogously we can compute the effect of a change in district income
from \(40\) to \(41\):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# set up data to predict}
\NormalTok{new_data <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{data.frame}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{income =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{40}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{41}\NormalTok{))}

\CommentTok{# compute the difference}
\KeywordTok{diff}\NormalTok{(Y_hat)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##         2 
## 0.4240097
\end{verbatim}

So for the quadratic model, the expected change in \(TestScore\) induced
by an increase in \(income\) from \(10\) to \(11\) is about \(2.96\)
points but an increase in \(income\) from \(40\) to \(41\) increases the
predicted score by only \(0.42\). Hence the slope of the estimated
quadratic regression function is \emph{steeper} at low levels of income
than at higher levels.

\subsection*{Logarithms}\label{logarithms}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Logarithms}

Another way to specify a nonlinear regression function is to use the
natural logarithm of \(Y\) and/or \(X\). Logarithms convert changes in
variables into percentage changes which is convenient as many
relationships are naturally expressed in terms of percentages.

There are three different cases in which logarithms might be used.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(X\) could be transformed by taking its logarithm but \(Y\) is not.
\item
  We could transform \(Y\) to its logarithm but leave \(X\) at level.
\item
  A third case is that both \(Y\) and \(X\) are transformed to their
  logarithms.
\end{enumerate}

The interpretation of the regression coefficients is different in each
case.

\subsubsection*{\texorpdfstring{Case I: \(X\) is in Logarithm, \(Y\) is
not.}{Case I: X is in Logarithm, Y is not.}}\label{case-i-x-is-in-logarithm-y-is-not.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Case I: \(X\) is in Logarithm,
\(Y\) is not.}

The regression model then is

\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \ln(X_i) + u_i \text{, } i=1,...,n. \]
Similar as for polynomial regression we do not have to create a new
variable by computing \(\ln(X)\). We can simply adjust the formula
argument of lm() to tell R that the log-transformation of a variable
should be used.

points. When income increases from \(\$40000\) to \(\$41000\), the
expected increase in test scores is only about \(0.90\) points.

If you want to learn about the absolute impact of an explanatory
variable on the dependent variable, it is not recommended to
log-transform the latter. There are, however, cases where we want to
learn about \(\ln(Y)\) instead of \(Y\).

The corresponding regression model then is

\[ \ln(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X_i + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,...,n. \]

Which of the models presented here is the most suitable one? Comparing
by \(\overline{R^2}\) we find that, leaving out the log-linear model,
all models have a similar fit. In the class of polynomial models, the
cubic specification has the highest \(\overline{R^2}\) whereas the
linear-log specification is the best of the log-models.

We see that both regression lines look nearly identical. Altogether The
linear-log model is preferable since it has a slightly higher
\(\overline{R^2}\) and is more parsimonious in terms of regressors: it
does not include higher-degree polynomials.

\section{Interactions Between Independent
Variables}\label{interactions-between-independent-variables}

There are research questions where it is interesting to learn how the
effect on \(Y\) of a change in an independent variable depends on the
value of another independent variable. For example, we may ask if
districts with many English learners benefit differentially from a
decrease in class sizes than those with few English learning students.
To assess this using a multiple regression model, we need to include an
interaction term. We will consider three cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Interactions between two binary variables.
\item
  Interactions between a binary and a continuous variable.
\item
  Interactions between two continuous variables.
\end{enumerate}

The following subsections discuss these cases briefly and demonstrate
how to perform such regressions using R.

\subsubsection*{Interactions Between Two Binary
Variables}\label{interactions-between-two-binary-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Interactions Between Two Binary
Variables}

Take two binary variables \(D_1\) and \(D_2\) and the population
regression model

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times D_{1i} + \beta_2 \times D_{2i} + u_i. \]

Now assume that

\begin{align}
  Y_i=& \, \ln(Earnings_i),\\
  \\
  D_{1i} =& \,
   \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $i^{th}$ person has a college degree,} \\
      0 & \text{else},
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
  D_{2i} =& \, 
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $i^{th}$ person is female} \\
      0 & \text{if $i^{th}$ person is male}.
    \end{cases}\\
\end{align}

We know that \(\beta_1\) measures the average difference in
\(\ln(Earnings)\) between individuals with and without a college degree
and \(\beta_2\) is the gender differential in \(\ln(Earnings)\), ceteris
paribus. This model \emph{does not} allow us to determine if there is a
gender specific effect of having a college degree and, if so, \emph{how
strong} this effect is. It is easy to come up with a model specification
that allows to investigate this:

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times D_{1i} + \beta_2 \times D_{2i} + \beta_3 \times (D_{1i} \times D_{2i}) + u_i \]

\((D_{1i} \times D_{2i})\) is called an interaction term and \(\beta_3\)
measures the difference in the effect of having a college degree for
women versus men.

\begin{keyconcepts}[A Method for Interpreting Coefficients in Regression with Binary Variables]{8.3}
Compute expected values of $Y$ for each possible set described by the set of binary variables. Compare the expected values. 
The coefficients can be expressed either as expected values or as the difference between at least two expected values.
\end{keyconcepts}

Following Key Concepts 8.3 we have

\begin{align*}
  E(Y_i\vert D_{1i}=0, D_{2i} = d_2) =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times 0 + \beta_2 \times d_2 + \beta_3 \times (0 \times d_2) \\
  =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_2 \times d_2.
\end{align*}

If \(D_{1i}\) switches from \(0\) to \(1\) we obtain

\begin{align*}
  E(Y_i\vert D_{1i}=1, D_{2i} = d_2) =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times 1 + \beta_2 \times d_2 + \beta_3 \times (1 \times d_2) \\
  =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 \times d_2 + \beta_3 d_2.
\end{align*}

Hence, the overall effect is

\[ E(Y_i\vert D_{1i}=1, D_{2i} = d_2) - E(Y_i\vert D_{1i}=0, D_{2i} = d_2) = \beta_1 + \beta_3 d_2 \]
so the effect is a difference of expected values.

of English
Learners}\label{application-to-the-student-teacher-ratio-and-the-percentage-of-english-learners}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Application to the Student-Teacher
Ratio and the Percentage of English Learners}

Now let

\begin{align*}
  HiSTR =& \, 
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if $STR \geq 20$} \\
      0, & \text{else},
    \end{cases} \\
  \\
  HiEL =& \,
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if $PctEL \geq 10\%$} \\
      0, & \text{else}.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

We may use R to construct the variables above as follows.

\end{Shaded}

We proceed by estimating the model

\[ TestScore_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times HiSTR + \beta_2 \times HiEL + \beta_3 \times (HiSTR \times HiEL) + u_i \]

using lm(). There are several ways to add an interaction term to the
formula argument when using lm() but the most intuitive way is to use
the product of both variables HiEL * HiSTR.

\end{verbatim}

The estimated regression model is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(1.39)}{664.1} - \underset{(1.93)}{1.9} \times HiSTR - \underset{(2.33)}{18.3} \times HiEL - \underset{(3.12)}{3.3} \times (HiSTR \times HiEL) \]

and it predicts that the effect of moving from a school district with a
low student-teacher ratio to a district with a high student-teacher
ratio, depending on high or low percentage of english learners is
\(-1.9-3.3\times HiEL\). So for districts with a low share of english
learners (\(HiEL = 0\)), the estimated effect is a decrease of \(1.9\)
points in test scores while for districts with a big fraction of english
learner (\(HiEL = 1\)), the predicted decrease in test scores amounts to
\(1.9 + 3.3 = 5.2\) points, on average.

We can also use the model to estimate the mean test score for each
possible combination of the included binary variables.

\(i\), which is a continuous variable. We than have

\begin{align*}
  Y_i =& \, \ln(Earnings_i), \\
  \\
  X_i =& \, \text{working experience of person }i, \\
  \\
  D_i =& \,  
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if $i^{th}$ person has a college degree} \\
      0, & \text{else}.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

The base model thus is

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 D_i + u_i, \]

a simple multiple regression model that allows us to estimate the
average benefit of having a college degree holding working experience
constant as well as the average effect on earnings of a change in
working experience holding college degree constant.

By adding the interaction term \(X_i \times D_i\) we allow the effect of
an additional year of work experience to differ for person with and
without college degree,

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 D_i + \beta_3  (X_i \times D_i) + u_i. \]

Here, \(\beta_3\) is the expected difference in the effect of an
additional year of work experience for college graduates versus
non-graduates. Another possible specification is

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 (X_i \times D_i) + u_i. \]

This model states that the expected impact of an additional year of work
experience on earnings differs for for college graduates and
non-graduates but that graduating on its own does not does not increase
earnings.

All three population regression functions can be visualized by straight
lines. Key Concept 8.4 summarizes the differences.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Interactions Between Binary and Continuous Variables]{8.4}
An interaction term like $X_i \times D_i$ (where $X_i$ is continuous and $D_i$ is binary) allows for the slope to depend on the binary
variable $D_i$. There are three possibilities:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Different intercept and same slope:
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 D_i + u_i $$
\item Different intercept and different slope:
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 D_i + \beta_3 \times (X_i \times D_i) + u_i $$
\item Same intercept and different slope:
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 (X_i \times D_i) + u_i $$
\end{enumerate}

\end{keyconcepts}

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Application to the Student-Teacher
Ratio and the Percentage of English Learners}

Using a model specification like the second one discussed in Key Concept
8.3 (different slope, different intercept) we may answer the question
whether the effect on test scores of decreasing the student-teacher
ratio depends on whether there are many or few English learners. We
estimate the regression model

\[ \widehat{TestScore_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times size_i + \beta_2 \times HiEL_i + \beta_2 (size_i \times HiEL_i) + u_i. \]

\end{verbatim}

The estimated regression model is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(11.87)}{682.2} - \underset{(0.59)}{0.97} \times size + \underset{(19.51)}{5.6} \times HiEL - \underset{(0.97)}{1.28} \times (size \times HiEL). \]

We find that the estimated regression line for districts with a low
fraction of English learners (\(HiEL_i=0\)) is

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = 682.2 - 0.97\times size_i. \]

For districts with a high fraction of English learners we have

\begin{align} 
  \widehat{TestScore} =& \, 682.2 + 5.6 - 0.97\times size_i - 1.28 \times size_i \\
   =& \, 687.8 - 2.25 \times size_i.
\end{align}

The predicted increase in test scores following a reduction of the
student-teacher ratio by \(1\) unit is about \(0.97\) points in
districts where the fraction of English learners is low but \(2.25\) in
districts with a high share of English learners. From the coefficient on
the interaction term \(size \times HiEL\) we see that the difference
between both effects is \(1.28\).

The next code chunk draws both lines belonging to the model. In order to
make observations with \(HiEL = 0\) distinguishable from those with
\(HiEL = 1\), we use different colors.

\subsubsection*{Interactions Between Two Continuous
Variables}\label{interactions-between-two-continuous-variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Interactions Between Two Continuous
Variables}

If we have a regression model with \(Y\) being the log earnings and two
continuous regressors \(X_1\), the years of work experience, and
\(X_2\), the years of schooling, a simple multiple regression model
cannot be used to estimate the effect on wages of an additional year of
work experience depending on a given level of schooling. This effect can
be assessed by including the interaction term \((X_{1i} \times X_{2i})\)
in the model:

\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 \times (X_{1i} \times X_{2i}) + u_i \]

Following Key Concept 8.1 we find that the effect on \(Y\) of a change
on \(X_1\) given \(X_2\) is
\[ \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X_1} = \beta_1 + \beta_3 X_2. \]

In the earnings example, a positive \(\beta_3\) implies that the effect
on log earnings of an additional year of work experience grows linearly
with years of schooling. Vice versa we have
\[ \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X_2} = \beta_2 + \beta_3 X_1 \] as the effect
on log earnings of an additional year of schooling holding work
experience constant.

Altogether we find that \(\beta_3\) measures the effect of a unit
increase in \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) beyond the effects of increasing \(X_1\)
alone and \(X_2\) alone by one unit. The overall change in \(Y\) is thus

\begin{align}
Y_i = (\beta_1 + \beta_3 X_2) \Delta X_1 + (\beta_2 + \beta_3 X_1) \Delta X_2 + \beta_3\Delta X_1 \Delta X_2. \label{eq:generalinteraction}
\end{align}

Key Concept 8.5 summarizes interactions between two regressors in
multiple regression.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Interactions in Multiple Regression]{8.5}
The interaction term between the two regressors $X_1$ and $X_2$ is given by their product $X_1 \times X_2$. Adding this
interaction term as a regressor to the model $$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + u_i $$ allows the effect on $Y$ of a change in $X_2$ to depend on the value of $X_1$ and vice versa. Thus the coefficient $\beta_3$ in the model $$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 (X_1 \times X_2) + u_i $$ measures the effect of a one-unit increase in both $X_1$ \textit{and} $X_2$ above and beyond the sum of both individual effects. This holds for continuous \textit{and} binary regressors.
\end{keyconcepts}

The estimated model equation is
\[ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(11.76)}{686.3} - \underset{(0.59)}{1.12} \times STR - \underset{(0.37)}{0.67} \times PctEL + \underset{(0.02)}{0.0012} \times (STR\times PctEL). \]

For the interpretation, let us consider the quartiles of \(PctEL\).

##   0.000   1.941   8.778  15.768  22.970  85.540
\end{verbatim}

According to \eqref{eq:generalinteraction}, if \(PctEL\) is at its median
value of \(8.78\), the slope of the regression function relating test
scores and the student teacher ratio is predicted to be
\(-1.12 + 0.0012 \times 8.78 = -1.11\). This means that increasing the
student-teacher ratio by one unit is expected to deteriorate test scores
by \(1.11\) points. For the \(75\%\) quantile, the estimated change on
\(TestScore\) of a one-unit increase in \(STR\) is estimated by
\(-1.12 + 0.0012 \times 23.0 = -1.09\) so the slope is somewhat lower.
The interpretation is that for a school district with a share of
\(23\%\) English learners, a reduction of the student-teacher ratio by
one unit is expected to increase the test scores by only \(1.09\)
points.

Note, however, that the output produced by summary() indicates that the
difference of the effect for the median and the \(75\%\) quantile is not
statistically significant. The \(p\)-value for the test
\(H_0: \beta_3 = 0\) cannot be rejected at the \(5\%\) level of
significance.

In this section we replicate the empirical example
\textit{The Demand for Economic Journals} presented at pages 336 - 337
of the book. The central question is: how elastic is the demand by
libraries for economic journals? The idea here is to analyze the
relationship between the number of subscription to a journal at U.S.
libraries and the journal's subscription price. The study uses the data
set Journals which is provided with the AER package and contains
observations for \(180\) economic journals for the year 2000. You can
use the help function (\texttt{?Journals}) to get more information on
the data after loading the package.

We measure the price as ``price per citation'' and have to compute

The lowest price observed is a mere \(0.5\)¢ per citation while the
highest price is more than \(20\)¢ per citation.

After loading and preparing the data, we estimate four different model
specifications. All models are log-log models. This is useful because it
allows us to directly interpret the coefficients as elasticities, see
Key Concept 8.2. \((I)\) is a simple linear model. To alleviate a
possible omitted variable bias, \((II)\) augments \((I)\) by the
covariates \(\ln(Age)\) and \(\ln(Characters)\). The largest model
\((III)\) attempts to capture non-linearities in the relationship of
\(\ln(Subscriptions)\) and \(\ln(PricePerCitation)\) using a cubic
regression function of \(\ln(PricePerCitation)\) and also adds the
interaction term \((PricePerCitation \times Age)\) while specification
\((IV)\) does not include the cubic term.

\begin{align*}
  (I)\quad \ln(Subscriptions_i) =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(PricePerCitation_i) + u_i \\

Using summary(), we obtain the following estimated model equations:

\begin{align*}
  (I)\quad \widehat{\ln(Subscriptions_i)} =& \, 4.77 - 0.53 \ln(PricePerCitation_i) \\
  \\
  (II)\quad \widehat{\ln(Subscriptions_i)} =& \, 3.21 - 0.41 \ln(PricePerCitation_i) + 0.42 \ln(Age_i) + 0.21 \ln(Characters_i) \\
  \\
  (III)\quad \widehat{\ln(Subscriptions_i)} =& \, 3.41 - 0.96 \ln(PricePerCitation_i) + 0.02 \ln(PricePerCitation_i)^2 \\
  +& \, 0.004 \ln(PricePerCitation_i)^3 + 0.37 \ln(Age_i) \\
  +& \, 0.16 \left[\ln(Age_i) \times \ln(PricePerCitation_i)\right] \\ +& \, 0.23 \ln(Characters_i) \\
  \\
  (IV)\quad \widehat{\ln(Subscriptions_i)} =& \, 3.43 - 0.90 \ln(PricePerCitation_i) + 0.37 \ln(Age_i) \\ 
  +&  \, 0.14 \left[\ln(Age_i) \times \ln(PricePerCitation_i)\right] + 0.23 \ln(Characters_i)
\end{align*}

It is of interest whether the coefficients the nonlinear transformations
of \(\ln(PricePerCitation)\) in Model \((III)\) are statistically
significant. To answer this, we use an \(F\)-Test.

Clearly, we cannot reject the null hypothesis \(H_0: \beta_3=\beta_4=0\)
in model \((III)\).

We now demonstrate how the function \texttt{stargazer()} can be used to
generate a verbose tabular representation of all four models.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-353-1} \end{center}

As can be seen from plots (a) and (b), the relation between
subscriptions and the citation price is inverse and nonlinear.
Log-transforming both variables makes it approximately linear. Plot (c)
shows that the price elasticity of journal subscriptions depends on the
journal's age: the red line shows the estimated relationship for
\(Age=80\) while the green line represents the prediction from model
\((IV)\) for \(Age=5\).

Which conclusion can be made?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We conclude that the demand for journals is more elastic for young
  journals than for old journals.
\item
  For model \((III)\) we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
  coefficients on \(\ln(PricePerCitation)^2\) and
  \(\ln(PricePerCitation)^3\) are both zero using an \(F\)-test. This is
  evidence supporting a linear relation between log-subscriptions and
  log-price.
\item
  Demand is greater for Journals with more characters, holding price and
  age constant.
\end{enumerate}

Hence we have found evidence, that the price elasticity of demand for
economic journals depends on the age of the journal. Altogether our
estimates suggest that the demand is very inelastic, i.e.~the libraries'
demand for economic journals is quite insensitive to the price: using
model \((IV)\), even for a young journal (\(Age=5\)) we estimate the
price elasticity to be
\(-0,899+0,374\times\ln(5)+0,141\times\left[\ln(1)\times\ln(5)\right] \approx -0.3\)
so a one percent increase in price is predicted to reduce the demand by
only \(0.3\) percent.

This finding comes at no surprise since providing the most recent
publications is a necessity for libraries.

\section{Nonlinear Effects on Test Scores of the Student-Teacher
Ratio}\label{nonlinear-effects-on-test-scores-of-the-student-teacher-ratio}

In this section we will discuss three specific questions about the
relationship between test scores and the student-teacher ratio:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Does the effect on test scores of decreasing the student-teacher ratio
  depend on the fraction of English learners when we control for
  economic idiosyncrasies of the different districts?
\item
  Does this effect depend on the the student-teacher ratio?
\item
  How strong is the effect of decreasing the student-teacher ratio (by
  two students per teacher) if we take into account economic
  characteristics and non-linearities?
\end{enumerate}

Two answer these questions we will consider a total of seven models,
some of which are nonlinear regression specifications of the types that
have been discussed before. As measures for the students' economic
backgrounds, we will additionally consider the regressors \(lunch\) and
\(\ln(income)\). We use the logarithm of \(income\) because the analysis
in Chapter \ref{nfoasiv} showed that the nonlinear relationship between
\(income\) and \(TestScores\) is approximately logarithmic. We do not
include expenditures per pupil (\(expenditure\)) because doing so would
imply that expenditures do vary with the student-teacher ratio (see
Chapter 7.2 of the book for a detailed argument).

Scores}\label{nonlinear-regression-models-of-test-scores}

Let us summarize what can be concluded from the results presented in
Table \ref{tab:nmots}.

First of all, it is apparent that the coefficient on \(size\) is
statistically significant in all seven models. Adding \(\ln(income)\) to
model (1) we find that the corresponding coefficient is statistically
significant at the level of \(1\%\) while all other coefficients remain
at their significance level. Furthermore, the estimate for the
coefficient on \(size\) is roughly \(0.27\) points larger which could be
a sign of attenuated omitted variable bias. We consider this a reason to
include \(\ln(income)\) as a regressor in other models, too.

Regressions (3) and (4) aim to assess the effect of allowing for an
interaction between \(size\) and \(HiEL\), without and with economic
control variables. In both models, both the coefficient on the
interaction term and the coefficient on the dummy are not statistically
significant. Thus, even with economic control variables we cannot the
reject the null hypothesis, that the effect of the student-teacher ratio
on test scores is the same for districts with high and districts with
low share of English learning students.

Regression (5) includes a cubic term for the student-teacher ratio and
omits the interaction between \(size\) and \(HiEl\). The results
indicate that there is a nonlinear effect of the student-teacher ratio
on test scores (Can you verify this using an \(F\)-test of
\(H_0: \beta_2=\beta_3=0\)?)

Consequently, regression (6) further explores whether the fraction of
english learners is also accountable for the effect of the
student-teacher ratio by using \(HiEL \times size\) and the interactions
\(HiEL \times size^2\) and \(HiEL \times size^3\). All individual
\(t\)-tests indicate that that there are significant effects. We check
this using a robust \(F\)-test of \(H_0: \beta_6=\beta_7=\beta_8=0\).

We find that the null can be rejected at the level of \(5\%\) and
conclude that the regression function differs for districts with high
and low percentage of English learners.

Specification (7) uses a continuous measure for the share of english
learners instead of a dummy variable (and thus does not include
interaction terms). We observe only small changes to the coefficient
estimates on the other regressors and thus conclude that the results
observed for specification (5) are not sensitive to the way the
percentage of English learners is measured.

We continue by reproducing Figure 8.10 of the book for interpretation of
the nonlinear specifications (2), (5) and (7).

Note that for the figure above all regressors except for \(size\) are
set to their sample averages. We see that the cubic regressions (5) and
(7) are almost identical. They indicate that the relation between test
scores and the student-teacher ratio has only a small amount of
non-linearity since they do not deviate much from the regression
function of (2).

The next code chunk reproduces Figure 8.11 of the book. We use plot()
and points() to color observations depending on \(HiEL\). Again, the
regression lines are drawn based on predictions using average sample

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-360-1} \end{center}

From the regression output we see that model (6) finds statistically
significant coefficients on the interaction terms \(HiEL:size\),
\(HiEL:size^2\) and \(HiEL:size^3\), i.e.~there is evidence that the
nonlinear relationship connecting test scores and student-teacher ration
depends on the amount of English learning students in the district.
However, the figure above shows that this difference is not of practical
importance and is a good example of why one should be careful when
interpreting nonlinear models: although the two regression functions
look different, we see that the slope of both functions is almost
identical for student-teacher ratios between \(17\) and \(23\). Since
this range includes almost \(90\%\) of all observations, we can be
confident about this.

One might be tempted to object since both functions show opposing slopes
for student-teacher ratios below \(15\) and beyond \(24\). Two things
can be put against that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  There are only few observations with low and high values of the
  student-teacher ratio so there is only little information to be
  exploited when estimating the model. This means the estimated function
  is less precise in the extremes of the data set.
\item
  Such a behavior is a typical caveat when using cubic functions since
  they generally show extreme behavior for extreme regressor values.
  Think of the graph of \(f(x) = x^3\).
\end{enumerate}

We thus conclude that there is no dependence of the relation between
class size and test scores on the percentage of English learners in the
district.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

We are now able to answer the three question posed at the beginning of
this section.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Considering the linear models, the percentage of English learners has
  only little influence on the effect of test scores of changing the
  student-teacher ratio. This result keeps valid if we control for
  economic background of the students. While the cubic specification (6)
  provides evidence, the strength of the effect is negligible.
\item
  When controlling for the students' economic background we find
  evidence of non-linearities in the relationship between
  student-teacher ratio and test scores.
\item
  The linear specification (2) predicts that a reduction of the
  student-teacher ratio by two students per teacher leads to an
  improvement in test scores of about \(-0.73 \times (-2) = 1.46\)
  points. Since the model is linear, this effect is independent of the
  class size. Assume that the student-teacher ratio is \(20\). For
  example, model (5) predicts that the reduction increases test scores
  by
  \[64.33*18+18^2*(-3.42)+18^3*(0.059) - (64.33*20+20^2*(-3.42)+20^3*(0.059)) \approx 3.3\]
  points. If the ratio is \(22\), a reduction to \(20\) leads to a
  predicted improvement in test scores of
  \[64.33*20+20^2*(-3.42)+20^3*(0.059) - (64.33*22+22^2*(-3.42)+22^3*(0.059)) \approx 2.4\]
  points. This suggests that the effect is stronger in smaller classes.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Assessing Studies Based on Multiple Regression}\label{asbomr}

The majority of Chapter 9 of the book is of a theoretical nature.
Therefore this section briefly reviews the concepts of internal and
external validity in general and discusses examples of threats to
internal and external validity of multiple regression models. We discuss
consequences of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Misspecification of the functional form of the regression function
\item
  Measurement errors
\item
  Missing data and sample selection
\item
  Simultaneous causality
\end{itemize}

as well as sources of inconsistency of OLS standard errors. We also
review concerns of internal validity and external validity in the
context of forecasting using regression models.

The chapter closes with an application in \texttt{R} where we assess
whether results found by multiple regression using the
\texttt{CASchools} data can be generalized to school districts of
another federal state of the United States.

For a more detailed treatment of these topics we encourage you to work
through Chapter 9 of the book.

The following packages and their dependencies are needed for
reproduction of the code chunks presented throughout this chapter:

\section{Internal and External
Validity}\label{internal-and-external-validity}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Internal and External Validity]{9.1}
A statistical analysis has \textit{internal} validity if the statistical inference made about causal effects are valid for the considered population.\newline

An analysis is said to have \textit{external} validity if inferences and conclusion are valid for the studies population and can be generalized to other populations and settings.
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsubsection*{Threats to Internal
Validity}\label{threats-to-internal-validity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Threats to Internal Validity}

For internal validity to exist, there are two conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The estimator of the causal effect, which is measured the
  coefficient(s) of interest, needs to be unbiased and consistent.
\item
  Statistical inference is valid, that is, hypothesis tests should have
  the desired significance level and confidence intervals should have
  the desired confidence level.
\end{enumerate}

In multiple regression, we estimate the model coefficients using OLS.
Thus for condition 1. to be fulfilled we need the OLS estimator to be
unbiased and consistent. For the second condition to be valid, the
standard errors must be valid such that hypothesis testing and
computation of confidence intervals yield results that are trustworthy.
Remember that a necessary condition for conditions 1. and 2. to be
fulfilled is that the assumptions of Key Concept 6.4 hold.

\subsubsection*{Threats to External
Validity}\label{threats-to-external-validity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Threats to External Validity}

External validity might be invalid

\begin{itemize}
\item
  if there are differences between the considered populations.
\item
  if there are differences in the settings of the considered
  populations, e.g.~the legal framework or the time of the
  investigation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Threats to Internal Validity of Multiple Regression
Analysis}\label{threats-to-internal-validity-of-multiple-regression-analysis}

This section treats five sources that cause the OLS estimator in
(multiple) regression models to be biased and inconsistent for the
causal effect of interest and discusses possible remedies. Note that all
five sources arise from violation of the first least squares assumption
presented in Key Concept 6.4.

This sections treats:

\begin{itemize}
\item

Beside these threats for consistency of the coefficient estimation, we

standard errors.

\subsubsection*{Omitted Variable Bias}\label{omitted-variable-bias-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Omitted Variable Bias}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Omitted Variable Bias: Should I include More Variables in My Regression? ]{9.2}

Inclusion of additional variables reduces the risk of omitted variable bias but may increase the variance of the estimator of the coefficient of interest.\newline 

We present some guidelines that help deciding whether to include an additional variable:\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item Specify the coefficient(s) of interest.
\item Identify the most important potential sources of omitted variable bias by using knowledge available   extit{before} estimating the model. You should end up with a base specification and a set of regressors that are questionable.
\item Use different model specifications to test whether questionable regressors have coefficients different from zero.
\item Use tables to provide full disclosure of your results i.e. present different model specifications that do both support your argument and enable the reader to see the effect of including questionable regressors.
\end{itemize}

\end{keyconcepts}

By now you should be aware of omitted variable bias and its
consequences. Key Concept 9.2 gives some guidelines on how to proceed if
there are control variables that possibly allow to reduce omitted
variable bias. If including additional variables to mitigate the bias is
not an option because there are no adequate controls, there are
different approaches to solve the problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Usage of panel data methods (discussed in Chapter \ref{rwpd})
\item
  Usage of instrumental variables regression (discussed in Chapter
  \ref{ivr})
\item
  Usage of a randomized control experiment (discussed in Chapter
  \ref{eaqe})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Misspecification of the Functional Form of the
Regression
Function}\label{misspecification-of-the-functional-form-of-the-regression-function}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Misspecification of the Functional
Form of the Regression Function}

If the population regression function is nonlinear but the regression
model is linear, we say that the functional form of the regression
function is misspecified. This leads to a bias of the OLS estimator.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Functional Form Misspecification]{9.3}
We say a regression suffers from misspecification of the functional form when the functional form of the estimated regression model differs from the functional form of the population regression function. Functional form misspecification leads to biased and inconsistent coefficient estimators. A way to detect functional form misspecification is to plot the estimated regression function and the data. This may also be helpful to choose the correct functional form.
\end{keyconcepts}

It is easy to come up with examples of misspecification of the
functional form: consider the case where the population regression
function is \[Y_i = - X_i^2\] but the model used is
\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i.\] Clearly, the regression function
is misspecified here. We now simulate data and visualize this.

It is evident that the regression errors are relatively small for
observations close to \(X=-3\) and \(X=3\) but that the errors increase
for \(X\) values closer to zero and even more for values beyond \(-4\)
and \(4\). Consequences are drastic: the intercept is estimated to be
\(8.1\) and for the slope parameter we obtain an estimate close to zero
which is obviously wrong. This issue does not disappear as the number of
observations is increased because OLS is biased \emph{and} inconsistent
due to the misspecification of the regression function.

\subsubsection*{Measurement Error and Errors-in-Variables
Bias}\label{measurement-error-and-errors-in-variables-bias}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Measurement Error and
Errors-in-Variables Bias}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Errors-in-Variable Bias]{9.4}
When independent variables are measured imprecisely, we speak of errors-in-variables bias. This bias does not disappear if the sample size is large. If the measurement error has mean zero and is independent of the affected variable, the OLS estimator of the respective coefficient is biased towards zero.
\end{keyconcepts}

Suppose you are incorrectly measuring the single regressor \(X_i\) so
that there is a measurement error and you observe
\(\overset{\sim}{X}_i\) instead of \(X_i\). Then, instead of estimating
the population the regression model
\[ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i \] you end up estimating

\begin{align*}
  Y_i =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \overset{\sim}{X}_i + \underbrace{\beta_1 (X_i - \overset{\sim}{X}_i) + u_i}_{=v_i} \\
  Y_i =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \overset{\sim}{X}_i + v_i
\end{align*}

where \(\overset{\sim}{X}_i\) and the error term \(v_i\) are correlated.
Thus OLS would be biased and inconsistent for the true \(\beta_1\) in
this example. One can show that direction and strength of the bias
depend on the correlation between the observed regressor,
\(\overset{\sim}{X}_i\), and the measurement error,
\(w_i =X_i - \overset{\sim}{X}_i\). This correlation in turn depends on
the type of the measurement error made.

The classical measurement error model assumes that the measurement
error, \(w_i\), has zero mean and that it is uncorrelated with the
variable, \(X_i\), and the error term of the population regression
model, \(u_i\):

\begin{equation}
  \overset{\sim}{X}_i = X_i + w_i \ \ , \ \ \rho_{w_i,u_i}=0 \ \ , \ \ \rho_{w_i,X_i}=0 
\end{equation}

Then it holds that

\begin{equation}
  \widehat{\beta}_1 \xrightarrow{p}{\frac{\sigma_{X}^2}{\sigma_{X}^2 + \sigma_{w}^2}} \label{eq:cmembias}
\end{equation}

which implies inconsistency as \(\sigma_{X}^2, \sigma_{w}^2 > 0\) such
that the fraction in \eqref{eq:cmembias} is smaller than \(1\). Note that
there are two extreme cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If there is no measurement error, \(\sigma_{w}^2=0\) such that
  \(\widehat{\beta}_1 \xrightarrow{p}{\beta_1}\).
\item
  if \(\sigma_{w}^2 \gg \sigma_{X}^2\) we have
  \(\widehat{\beta}_1 \xrightarrow{p}{0}\). This is the case if the
  measurement error is so large that there essentially is no information
  on \(X\) in the data that can be used to estimate \(\beta_1\).
\end{enumerate}

The most obvious way to deal with errors-in-variables bias is to use an
accurately measured \(X\). If this not possible, instrumental variables
regression can be an option. One might also deal with the issue by using
a mathematical model of the measurement error and adjust the estimates
appropriately: if it is plausible that the classical measurement error
model applies and if there is information that can be used to estimate
the ratio in equation \eqref{eq:cmembias}, one could compute an estimate
that corrects for the downward bias.

For example, consider two bivariate normally distributed random
variables \(X,Y\). It is a well known result, that the conditional
expectation function of \(Y\) given \(X\) has the form

\begin{align}
  E(Y\vert X) = E(Y) + \rho_{X,Y} \frac{\sigma_{Y}}{\sigma_{X}}\left[X-E(X)\right]. \label{eq:bnormexpfn} 
\end{align}

Thus for

\begin{align}
  (X, Y) \sim \mathcal{N}\left[\begin{pmatrix}50\\ 100\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}10 & 5 \\ 5 & 10 \end{pmatrix}\right] \label{eq:bvnormd}
\end{align}

according to \eqref{eq:bnormexpfn}, the population regression function is

\begin{align*}
  Y_i =& \, 100 + 0.5 (X - 50) \\
      =& \, 75 + 0.5 X.
\end{align*}

Now suppose you gather data on \(X\) and \(Y\), but that you can only
measure \(\overset{\sim}{X_i} = X_i + w_i\) with
\(w_i \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,\sqrt{10})\). Since the
\(w_i\) are independent of the \(X_i\), there is no correlation between
the \(X_i\) and the \(w_i\) so that we have a case of the classical
measurement error model. We now illustrate this example in \texttt{R}
using the package \texttt{mvtnorm} \citep{R-mvtnorm}.

Notice that in the situation without measurement error, the estimated
regression function is close to the population regression function.
Things are different when we use the error afflicted data on \(X\): both
the estimate for the intercept and the estimate for the coefficient on
\(X\) differ considerably from results obtained using the ``clean'' data
on \(X\). In particular \(\widehat{\beta}_1 = 0.255\), so there is a
downward bias. We are in the comfortable situation to know
\(\sigma_X^2\) and \(\sigma^2_w\). This allows us to correct for the
bias using \eqref{eq:cmembias}. Using this information we obtain the
biased-corrected estimate
\[\frac{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_w^2}{\sigma_X^2} \cdot \widehat{\beta}_1 = \frac{10+10}{10} \cdot 0.255 = 0.51\]
which is quite close to \(\beta_1=0.5\), the true coefficient from the
population regression function.

\subsubsection*{Missing Data and Sample
Selection}\label{missing-data-and-sample-selection}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Missing Data and Sample Selection}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Sample Selection Bias]{9.5}
When the sampling process influences the availability of data and when there is a relation of this sampling process to the dependent variable that goes beyond the dependence on the regressors, we say that there is a sample selection bias. This bias is due to correlation between one or more regressors and the error term. Sample selection implies both bias and inconsistency of the OLS estimator.
\end{keyconcepts}

There are three cases of sample selection but only one of which poses a
threat to internal validity of a regression study. The three cases are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Data are missing at random.
\item
  Data are missing based on the value of a regressor.
\item
  Data are missing due to a selection process which is related to the
  dependent variable.
\end{enumerate}

Let us jump back to the example of variables \(X\) and \(Y\) distributed
as stated in equation \eqref{eq:bvnormd} and illustrate all three cases
using \texttt{R}.

If data are missing at random, this is nothing but loosing observations.
For example, loosing \(50\%\) of the sample would be the same as never
having seen the (randomly chosen) half of the sample observed.
Therefore, missing data do not introduce an estimation bias.

The gray dots represent the \(500\) discarded observations. When using
the remaining observations, the estimation results deviate only
marginally from the results obtained using the full sample.

Selecting data randomly based on the value of a regressor has also the
effect of reducing the sample size and does not introduce estimation
bias. We will now drop all observations with \(X > 45\), estimate the
model again and compare.

Note that although we dropped more than \(90\%\) of all observations,
the estimated regression function is very close to the line estimated
based on the full sample.

In the third case we face sample selection bias. We can illustrate this
by using only observations with \(X_i<55\) and \(Y_i>100\). These
observations are easily identified using the function \texttt{which()}
and logical operators:
\texttt{which(dat\$X\ \textless{}\ 55\ \&\ dat\$Y\ \textgreater{}\ 100)}

We see that the selection process leads to biased estimation results.

There are methods that allow to correct for sample selection bias.
However, these methods are beyond the scope of the book and are
therefore not considered here. The concept of sample selection bias is
summarized in Key Concept 9.5.

\subsubsection*{Simultaneous Causality}\label{simultaneous-causality}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Simultaneous Causality}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Simultaneous Causality Bias]{9.6}
So far we have assumed that the changes in the independent variable $X$ are responsible for changes in the dependent variable $Y$. When the reverse is also true, we say that there is <tt>simultaneous causality</tt> between $X$ and $Y$. This reverse causality leads to correlation between $X$ and the error in the population regression of interest such that the coefficient on $X$ is estimated with a bias.
\end{keyconcepts}

Suppose we are interested in estimating the effect of a \(20\%\)
increase in cigarettes prices on cigarette consumption in the United
States using a multiple regression model. This may be investigated using
the data set \texttt{CigarettesSW} which is part of the \texttt{AER}
package. \texttt{CigarettesSW} is a panel data set on cigarette
consumption for all 48 continental U.S. federal states from 1985-1995
and provides data on economic indicators and average local prices, taxes
and per capita pack consumption.

After loading the data set, we pick observations for the year 1995 and
plot logarithms of average federal and local excise taxes, \texttt{tax},
against pack consumption, \texttt{packs}, and estimate a simple linear
regression model.

Remember from Chapter \ref{nrf} that, due to the log-log specification,
in the population regression the coefficient on the logarithm of price
is interpreted as the price elasticity of consumption. The estimated
coefficient suggests that a \(1\%\) increase in cigarettes prices
reduces cigarette consumption by about \(1.2\%\), on average. Have we
estimated a demand curve? The answer is no: this is a classic example of
simultaneous causality, see Key Concept 9.6. The observations are market
equilibria which are determined by both changes in supply and changes in
demand. Therefore the price is correlated with the error term and the
OLS estimator is biased. We can neither estimate a demand nor a supply
curve consistently using this approach.

We will return to this issue in Chapter \ref{ivr} which treats
instrumental variables regression, an approach that allows consistent
estimation when there is simultaneous causality.

\subsubsection*{Sources of Inconsistency of OLS Standard
Errors}\label{sources-of-inconsistency-of-ols-standard-errors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Sources of Inconsistency of OLS
Standard Errors}

There are two central threats to computation of consistent OLS standard
errors:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Heteroskedasticity: implications of heteroskedasticiy have been
  discussed in Chapter \ref{htaciitslrm}. Heteroskedasticity-robust
  standard errors as computed by the function \texttt{vcovHC()} from the
  package \texttt{sandwich} produce valid standard errors under
  heteroskedasticity.
\item
  Serial correlation: if the population regression error is correlated
  across observations, we speak of serial correlation. This happens
  often in applications were repeated observations are used, e.g.~in
  panel data studies. As for heteroskedasticity, \texttt{vcovHC()} can
  be used to obtain valid standard errors when there is serial
  correlation.
\end{enumerate}

Inconsistent standard errors will produce invalid hypothesis tests and
wrong confidence intervals. For example, when testing the null
hypothesis that some model coefficient is zero, we cannot trust the
outcome anymore because the test may fail to have the significance level
of \(5\%\) due to the wrongly computed standard error.

Key Concept 9.7 summarizes all threats to internal validity discussed
above.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Threats to Internal Validity of a Regression Study ]{9.7}
The five primary threats to internal validity of a multiple regression study are:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Omitted variables
\item Misspecification of functional form
\item Errors in variables (measurement errors in the regressors)
\ Sample selection
\ Simultaneous causality
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

All these threats lead to failure of the first least squares assumption $$E(u_i\vert X_{1i},\dots ,X_{ki}) \neq 0$$ so that the OLS estimator is biased \textit{and} inconsistent.

Furthermore, if one does not adjust for heteroskedasticity \textit{and}/\textit{or} serial correlation, incorrect standard errors may be a threat to internal validity of the study.
\end{keyconcepts}

\section{Internal and External Validity When the Regression is Used for
Forecasting}\label{internal-and-external-validity-when-the-regression-is-used-for-forecasting}

Recall the regression of test scores on the student-teacher ratio
(\(STR\)) performed in Chapter \ref{lrwor}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{linear_model <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{lm}\NormalTok{(score }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{STR, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ CASchools)}
\NormalTok{linear_model}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ STR, data = CASchools)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)          STR  
##      698.93        -2.28
\end{verbatim}

The estimated regression function was

\[ \widehat{TestScore} = 698.9 - 2.28 \times STR.\]

The book discusses the example of a parent moving to a metropolitan area
who plans to choose where to live based on the quality of local schools:
a school districts average test score is an adequate measure for the
quality. However, the parent has information on the student-teacher
ratio only such that test scores need to be predicted. Although we have
established that there is omitted variable bias in this model due to
omission of variables like student learning opportunities outside
school, the share of English learners and so on, \texttt{linear\_model}
may in fact be useful for the parent:

The parent does not care if the coefficient on \(STR\) has causal
interpretation, she wants \(STR\) to explain as much variation in test
scores as possible. Therefore, despite the fact that
\texttt{linear\_model} cannot be used to estimate the \emph{causal
effect} of a change in \(STR\) on test scores, it can be considered a
\emph{reliable predictor} of test scores in general.

Thus, the threats to internal validity as summarized in Key Concept 9.7
are negligible for the parent. This is, as instanced in the book,
different for a superintendent who has been tasked to take measures that
increase test scores: she requires a more reliable model that does not
suffer from the threats listed in Key Concept 9.7.

Consult Chapter 9.3 of the book for the corresponding discussion.

\section{Example: Test Scores and Class Size}\label{etsacs}

This section discusses internal and external validity of the results
gained from analyzing the California test score data using multiple
regression models.

\subsubsection*{External Validity of the
Study}\label{external-validity-of-the-study}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{External Validity of the Study}

External validity of the California test score analysis means that its
results can be generalized. If this is possible depends on the
population and the setting. Following the book we conduct the same
analysis using data for fourth graders in \(220\) public school
districts in Massachusetts in 1998. Like \texttt{CASchools}, the data
set \texttt{MASchools} is part of the \texttt{AER} package
\citep{R-AER}. Use the help function (\texttt{?MASchools}) to get info
on the definitions of all the variables contained.

We start by loading the data set and proceed by computing some summary

The summary statistics reveal that the average test score is higher for
school districts in Massachusetts. Notice that the test used in
Massachusetts is somewhat different from the one used in California (the
Massachusetts test score also includes results for the school subject
``Science''), therefore a direct comparison of test scores is not
appropriate. We also see that, on average, classes are smaller in
Massachusetts than in California and that the average district income,
average percentage of English learners as well as the average share of
students receiving subsidized lunch differ considerably from the
averages computed for California. There are also notable differences in
the observed dispersion of the variables.

Following the book we examine the relationship between district income
and test scores in Massachusetts as we have done before in Chapter
\ref{nrf} for the California data and reproduce Figure 9.2 of the book.

Interestingly, this is different from the \texttt{CASchools} data where
the pattern of nonlinearity is better described by the linear-log
specification.

We continue by estimating most of the model specifications used for
analysis of the \texttt{CASchools} data set in Chapter \ref{nrf} and use
\texttt{stargazer()} \citep{R-stargazer} to generate a tabular
representation of the regression results.

We see that, in terms of \(\overline{R^2}\), specification (3) which
uses a cubic to model the relationship between district income and test
scores indeed does perform better the the linear-log specification (2).
Using different \(F\)-tests on models (4) and (5), we cannot reject the
hypothesis that there is no nonlinear relationship between student
teacher ratio and test score and also that the share of English learners
has an influence on the relationship of interest. Furthermore,
regression (6) shows that percentage of English learners can be omitted
as a regressor. Because changes of the model specification made in
regressions (4) to (6) do not lead to substantially different results
than those of regression (3), we choose model (3) as the most suitable
specification.

In comparison to the California data, we observe the following results:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Controlling for the students background characteristics in model
  specification (2) reduces the coefficient of interest (student-teacher
  ratio) by roughly \(60\%\). The estimated coefficients are close to
  each other.
\item
  The coefficient on student-teacher ratio is always significantly
  different from zero at the level of \(1\%\) for both data sets. This
  holds for all considered model specifications in both studies.
\item
  In both studies the share of English learners in a school district is
  of little importance for the estimated impact of a change in the
  student-teacher ratio on test score.
\end{enumerate}

The biggest difference is that, in contrast to the California results,
we do not find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between test scores
and the student teacher ratio for the Massachusetts data since the
corresponding \(F\)-tests for model (4) do not reject.

As pointed out in the book, the test scores for California and
Massachusetts have different units because the underlying tests are
different. Thus the estimated coefficients on the student-teacher ratio
in both regressions cannot be compared before standardizing test scores
to the same units as
\[\frac{Testscore - \overline{TestScore}}{\sigma_{TestScore}}\] for all
observations in both data sets and running the regressions of interest
using the standardized data again. One can show that the coefficient on
student-teacher ratio in the regression using standardized test scores
is the coefficient of the original regression divided by the standard
deviation of test scores.

For model (3) of the Massachusetts data, the estimated coefficient on
the student-teacher ratio is \(-0.64\). A reduction of the
student-teacher ratio by two students is predicted to increase test
scores by \(-2 \cdot (-0.64) = 1.28\) points. Thus we can compute the
effect of a reduction of student-teacher ratio by two students on the
standardized test scores as follows:

For Massachusetts the predicted increase of test scores due to a
reduction of the student-teacher ratio by two students is \(0.085\)
standard deviation of the distribution of the observed distribution of
test scores.

Beholding the linear specification (2) for California, the estimated
coefficient on the student-teacher ratio is \(-0.73\) so the predicted
increase of test scores induced by a reduction of the student-teacher
ratio by two students is \(-0.73 * (-2) = 1.46\). We use \texttt{R} to
compute the predicted change in standard deviation units:

This shows that the the predicted increase of test scores due to a
reduction of the student-teacher ratio by two students is \(0.077\)
standard deviation of the observed distribution of test scores for the
California data.

In terms of standardized test scores, the predicted change is
essentially the same for school districts in California and
Massachusetts.

Altogether, the results are in favor of the presumption that inference
made using data on Californian elementary school districts is externally
valid.

\subsubsection*{Internal Validity of the
Study}\label{internal-validity-of-the-study}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Internal Validity of the Study}

External validity of the study \emph{does not} ensure their internal
validity. Though the chosen model specification improves upon a simple
linear regression model, internal validity may still be violated due to
some of the threats listed in Key Concept 9.7. These threats are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Omitted variable bias
\item
  Misspecification of functional form
\item
  Errors in variables
\item
  Sample selection issues
\item
  Simultaneous causality
\item
  Heteroskedasticity
\item
  Correlation of errors across observations
\end{itemize}

Consult the book for an in-depth discussion of these threats in view of
both test score studies.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

We have found that there \emph{is} a statistically significant effect of
the student-teacher ratio on test scores although it is quite small.
However, it remains unclear if we have indeed estimated the causal
effect of interest since --- despite that our approach includes control
variables, takes into account nonlinearities in the population
regression function and statistical inference is made using robust
standard errors --- the results might still be biased for example if
there are omitted factors which we have not considered. Thus
\emph{internal validity} of the study remains questionable. As we have
concluded from comparison with the analysis of the Massachusetts data
set, this result is \emph{externally valid}.

The following chapters address techniques that can be remedies to all
the threats to internal validity named in Key Concept 9.7 if multiple
regression alone is insufficient. This includes regression using panel
data and approaches that employ instrumental variables.

\chapter{Regression with Panel Data}\label{rwpd}

Regression using panel data may mitigate omitted variable bias when
there is no information on variables available that correlate with both
the regressors of interest and the independent variable and if these
variables are constant in the time dimension or across entities.
Provided that panel data is availabe, panel regression methods may
improve upon multiple regression models which, as discussed in Chapter
\ref{asbomr}, produce results that are not internally valid in such a
setting.

This chapter covers the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Notation for panel data
\item
  Fixed effects regression using time and/or entity fixed effects
\item
  Computation of standard errors in fixed effects regression models
\end{itemize}

Following the book, for applications we make use of the data set
\texttt{Fatalities} from the \texttt{AER} package \citep{R-AER} which is
a panel data set reporting annually state level observations on U.S.
traffic fatalities for the period 1982 through 1988. The applications
are concerned with the question if there are effects of alcohol taxes
and drunk driving laws on road fatalities and, if present, \emph{how
strong} these effects are.

For this purpose we will introduce a convenient \texttt{R} function that
enables us to estimate linear panel regression models, the function
\texttt{plm()} which comes with the package \texttt{plm} \citep{R-plm}.
Usage of \texttt{plm()} is very similar as for the function
\texttt{lm()} which we have used throughout the previous chapters for
estimation of simple and multiple regression models.

The following packages and their dependencies are needed for
reproduction of the code chunks presented throughout this chapter on
your computer:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{AER}
\item
  \texttt{plm}
\item
  \texttt{stargazer}
\end{itemize}

\section{Panel Data}\label{panel-data}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Notation for Panel Data]{10.1}
In contrast to cross-section data where we have observations on $n$ subjects (entities), panel data has observations on $n$ entities at $T\geq2$ time periods. This is denoted $$(X_{it},Y_{it}), \ i=1,\dots,n \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ t=1,\dots,T $$
where the index $i$ refers to the entity while $t$ refers to the time period.
\end{keyconcepts}

Sometimes panel data is also called longitudinal data as it adds a
temporal dimension to cross-sectional data. Let us have a glimpse at the
data set \texttt{Fatalities} by checking its structure and listing the
first few observations.

We find that the data set consists of 336 observations on 34 variables.
Notice that the variable \texttt{state} is a factor variable with 48
levels (one for each of the 48 contiguous federal states of the U.S.).
The variable \texttt{year}is also a factor variable that has 7 levels
identifying the time period when the observation was made which gives us
\(7\times48 = 336\) observations in total. Since all variables are
observed for all entities and over all time periods we say the the panel
is \emph{balanced}. If there were missing data for at least one entities
in at least one time period we would call the panel \emph{unbalanced}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Example: Traffic Deaths and Alcohol

Coming to the question of how the alcohol taxes and traffic fatalities
are related, we start by reproducing Figure 10.1 of the book. For this
we estimate simple regressions using data for years 1982 and 1988 that
model the relationship between beer tax (adjusted for 1988 dollars) and
the traffic fatality rate. Beforehand we define the latter as the number
of fatalities per 10000 inhabitants and choose subsets of the
observations made for years 1982 and 1988. Afterwards, we plot both
subsets and add the corresponding estimated regression functions.

In both plots, each point represents observations of beer tax and
fatality rate for a given state in the respective year. The regression
results indicate a positive relationship between the beer tax and the
fatality rate for both years, whereby the estimated coefficient on beer
tax for the 1988 data is almost three times as large as for the 1988
data set. This is contrary to our expectations: alcohol taxes are
supposed to \emph{lower} the rate of traffic fatalities. As known from
Chapter \ref{rmwmr}, this is possibly due to omitted variable bias,
since both models do not include any covariates, e.g.~economic
conditions. This could be corrected for using a multiple regression
approach. However, both models cannot account for omitted
\emph{unobservable} factors that differ from state to state but can be
assumed to be constant over the observation span, e.g.~the populations
attitude towards drunk driving. As shown in the next section, panel data
allow us to hold such factors constant.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Panel Data with Two Time Periods: ``Before and
After''
Comparisons}{Panel Data with Two Time Periods: Before and After Comparisons}}\label{PDWTTP}

Suppose there are only \(T=2\) time periods \(t=1982,1988\). This allows
us to analyze differences in changes of the the fatality rate from year
1982 to 1988. We start by considering the population regression model
\[FatalityRate_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 BeerTax_{it} + \beta_2 Z_{i} + u_{it}\]
where the \(Z_i\) are state specific characteristics that differ between
states but are \emph{constant over time}. For \(t=1982\) and \(t=1988\)
we have

\begin{align*}
  FatalityRate_{i1982} =&\, \beta_0 + \beta_1 BeerTax_{i1982} + \beta_2 Z_i + u_{i1982}, \\
  FatalityRate_{i1988} =&\, \beta_0 + \beta_1 BeerTax_{i1988} + \beta_2 Z_i + u_{i1988}.
\end{align*}

We can eliminate the \(Z_i\) by regressing the difference in the
fatality rate between 1988 and 1982 on the difference in beer tax
between those years:
\[FatalityRate_{i1988} - FatalityRate_{i1982} = \beta_1 (BeerTax_{i1988} - BeerTax_{i1982}) + u_{i1988} - u_{i1982}\]
Using this regression model we can obtain an estimate for \(\beta_1\)
without worrying about a possible bias due to omission of the \(Z_i\)
since these influences are eliminated from the model. Next we use use
\texttt{R} to estimate a regression based on the differenced data and
plot the estimated regression function.

change in the beer tax.

We observe that the estimated coefficient on beer tax is now negative
and significantly different from zero at the level of \(5\%\). Its
interpretation is that raising the beer tax by \(\$1\) causes traffic
fatalities to decrease by \(1.04\) per \(10000\) people. This is rather
large as the average fatality rate is approximately \(2\) persons per
\(10000\) people.

Once more this outcome is likely to be a consequence of omitting factors
that influence the fatality rate and are correlated with the beer tax
\emph{and} change over time. The message is that we need to be more
careful and control for such factors before drawing conclusion about the
effect of a raise in beer taxes.

Furthermore, note that the approach presented in this section discards
information for years \(1983\) to \(1987\). A method that allows to use
data for more than \(T=2\) time periods and enables us to add control
variables is the fixed effects regression approach.

\section{Fixed Effects Regression}\label{fixed-effects-regression}

Consider the panel regression model

\[Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \beta_2 Z_i +  u_{it}\] where the
\(Z_i\) are unobserved time-invariant heterogeneities across the
entities \(i=1,\dots,n\). We are interested in estimating \(\beta_1\),
the effect on \(Y_i\) of a change in \(X_i\) holding constant \(Z_i\).
Letting \(\alpha_i = \beta_0 + \beta_2 Z_i\) we obtain the model

\begin{align}
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 X_{it} + u_{it} \label{eq:femodel}.
\end{align}

Having individual specific intercepts \(\alpha_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\),
where each of these can be understood as the fixed effect of entity
\(i\), this model is called the \emph{fixed effects regression model}.
The variation in the \(\alpha_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\) comes from the
\(Z_i\). \eqref{eq:femodel} can be rewritten as a regression model
containing \(n-1\) dummy regressors and a constant:

\begin{align}
Y_{it} = \beta_i + \beta_1 X_{it} + \gamma_2 D2_i + \gamma_3 D3_i + \cdots + \gamma_n Dn_i + u_{it} \label{eq:drmodel}.
\end{align}

Model \eqref{eq:drmodel} has \(n\) different intercepts --- one for every
entity. Both \eqref{eq:femodel} and \eqref{eq:drmodel} are equivalent
representations of the fixed effects regression model.

The fixed effects regression model can be generalized to contain more
than just one determinant of \(Y\) that is correlated with \(X\) and
changes over time. Key Concept 10.2 presents the generalized fixed
effects regression model.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Fixed Effects Regression Model]{10.2}
The fixed effects regression model is
\begin{align}
Y_{it} = \beta_1 X_{1,it} + \cdots + \beta_k X_{k,it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} \label{eq:gfemodel}
\end{align}
with $i=1,\dots,n$ and $t=1,\dots,T$. The $\alpha_i$ are entity-specific intercepts that capture heterogeneities across entities. An equivalent representation of this model is given by
\begin{align}
Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1,it} + \cdots + \beta_k X_{k,it} + \gamma_2 D2_i + \gamma_3 D3_i + \cdots + \gamma_n Dn_i  + u_{it} \label{eq:gdrmodel}
\end{align}
where the $D2_i,D3_i,\dots,Dn_i$ are dummy variables.
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsection*{Estimation and Inference}\label{estimation-and-inference}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Estimation and Inference}

Software packages use a so-called ``entity-demeaned'' OLS algorithm
which is computationally more efficient than estimating regression
models with \(k+n\) regressors as needed for models \eqref{eq:gfemodel}
and \eqref{eq:gdrmodel}.

Taking averages on both sides of \eqref{eq:femodel} we obtain

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_{it} =& \, \beta_1 \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_{it} + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n u_{it} \\
\overline{Y} =& \, \beta_1 \overline{X}_i + \alpha_i + \overline{u}_i. 
\end{align*}

Subtraction from \eqref{eq:femodel} yields

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
Y_{it} - \overline{Y}_i =& \, \beta_1(X_{it}-\overline{X}_i) + (u_{it} - \overline{u}_i) \\
\overset{\sim}{Y}_{it} =& \, \beta_1 \overset{\sim}{X}_{it} + \overset{\sim}{u}_{it}. 
\end{split} \label{eq:edols}
\end{align}

In this model, the OLS estimate of the parameter of interest \(\beta_1\)
is equal to the estimate obtained using \eqref{eq:drmodel} --- without the
need to estimate \(n-1\) dummies and an intercept.

We conclude that there are two ways of estimating \(\beta_1\) in the
fixed effects regression:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  OLS regression of the dummy regression model as shown in
  \eqref{eq:drmodel}
\item
  OLS regression using the entity demeaned data as in \eqref{eq:edols}
\end{enumerate}

Provided the fixed effects regression assumptions stated in Key Concept
10.3 hold, the sampling distribution of the OLS estimator in the fixed
effects regression model has a normal distribution in large samples. The
variance of the estimates can be estimated and we can compute standard
errors, \(t\)-statistics and confidence intervals for model
coefficients. In the next section, we will see how to estimate a fixed
effects model using \texttt{R} and how to obtain a model summary that
reports heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Thereby we leave
aside complicated formulas of the estimators. See Chapter 10.5 and
Appendix 10.2 of the book for a discussion of the theoretical aspects.

\subsection*{Application to Traffic
Deaths}\label{application-to-traffic-deaths}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Application to Traffic Deaths}

Following Key Concept 10.2, the simple fixed effects model for
estimation of the relation between traffic fatality rates and the beer
taxes is

\begin{align}
\widehat{FatalityRate}_{it} = \beta_1 BeerTax_{it} + StateFixedEffects + u_{it}, \label{eq:fatsemod}
\end{align}

a regression of the traffic fatality rate on beer tax and 48 binary
regressors --- one for each federal state.

We can simply use the function \texttt{lm()} to obtain an estimate of
\(\beta_1\).

As discussed in the previous section, it is also possible to estimate
\(\beta_1\) by applying OLS to the demeaned data, that is, to run the
regression

As for \texttt{lm()} we have to specify the regression formula and the

required to pass a vector of names of entity and time ID variables to

for entities is named \texttt{state} and the time id variable is
\texttt{year}. Since the fixed effects estimator is also called the
\emph{within estimator}, we set \texttt{model = "within"}. Finally, the
function \texttt{coeftest()} allows to obtain significance based on
robust standard errors.

\end{verbatim}

Again, we find that the estimated coefficient is \(-0.6559\). Note that
\texttt{plm()} uses the entity-demeaned OLS algorithm and thus does not
report dummy coefficients. The estimated regression function is

\begin{align}
\widehat{FatalityRate} = -\underset{(0.29)}{0.66} \times BeerTax + StateFixedEffects. \label{eq:efemod}
\end{align}

We find that the coefficient on \(BeerTax\) is negative and highly
significant. The interpretation is that the estimated reduction in
traffic fatalities due to an increase in the real beer tax by \(\$1\) is
\(0.66\) per \(10000\) people which is still pretty high. Although
including state fixed effects eliminates the risk of a bias due to
omitted factors that vary across states but not over time, we suspect
that there are other omitted variables that vary over time and thus
cause a bias.

\section{Regression with Time Fixed
Effects}\label{regression-with-time-fixed-effects}

Controlling for variables that are constant across entities but vary
over time can be done by including time fixed effects. If there are
\emph{only} time fixed effects, the fixed effects regression model
becomes
\[Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \delta_2 B2_t + \cdots + \delta_T BT_t + u_{it},\]
where only \(T-1\) dummies are included (\(B1\) is omitted) since the
model includes an intercept. This model eliminates omitted variables
bias caused by excluding unobserved variables that evolve over time but
are constant across entities only.

In some applications it is meaningful to include entity and time fixed
effects. The \emph{entity and time fixed effects} regression model is
\[Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \gamma_2 D2_i + \cdots + \gamma_n DT_i + \delta_2 B2_t + \cdots + \delta_T BT_t + u_{it} .\]
The combined model allows to eliminate bias from unobservables that
change over time but are constant over entities and it controls for
factors that differ across entities but are constant over time. Such
models can be estimated using the OLS algorithm that is implemented in
\texttt{R}.

The following code chunk shows how to estimate the combined entity and
time fixed effects model of the relation between fatalities and beer
tax,
\[FatalityRate_{it} = \beta_1 BeerTax_{it} + StateEffects + TimeFixedEffects + u_{it}\]
using both, \texttt{lm()} and \texttt{plm()}. It is straightforward to
estimate this regression with \texttt{lm()} since it is just an
extension of \eqref{eq:fatsemod} so we only have to adjust the
\texttt{formula} argument by adding the additional regressor
\texttt{year} for time fixed effects. In our call of \texttt{plm()} we
set another argument \texttt{effect = "twoways"} for inclusion of entity
\emph{and} time dummies.

Notice that since we exclude the intercept, \texttt{lm()} does estimate
coefficients for \((n-1) + (T-1) = 47 + 6 = 53\) binary variables!
Again, \texttt{plm()} does only report the estimated coefficient on
\(BeerTax\).

The estimated regression function is

\begin{align}
\widehat{FatalityRate} =  -\underset{(0.35)}{0.64} \times BeerTax + StateEffects + TimeFixedEffects. \label{eq:cbnfemod}
\end{align}

The value of \(-0.66\), the result is close to the estimated coefficient
for the regression model including only entity fixed effects.
Unsurprisingly, the coefficient is less precisely estimated as before
but significantly different from zero at the level of \(10\%\).

In view of \eqref{eq:efemod} and \eqref{eq:cbnfemod} we conclude that the
estimated relationship between traffic fatalities and the real beer tax
is not affected by omitted variable bias due to factors that are
constant over time.

\section{The Fixed Effects Regression Assumptions and Standard Errors
for Fixed Effects Regression}\label{tferaaseffer}

This section focuses on the entity fixed effects regression model and
presents model assumptions that need to hold in order for OLS to produce
unbiased estimates that are normally distributed for large sample sizes.
These assumptions are an extension of the assumptions made for the
multiple regression model (see Key Concept 6.4) and are given in Key
Concept 10.3. We will also briefly discuss standard errors in fixed
effects regression models which differ from standard errors in multiple
regression as the regression error can exhibit serial correlation in
panel models.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Fixed Effects Regression Assumptions]{10.3}
In the fixed effects regression model $$ Y_{it} = \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n, \ t=1,\dots,T, $$ we assume the following:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item The error term $u_{it}$ has conditional mean zero, that is, $E(u_{it}|u_{i1}, u_{i2},\dots, u_{iT})$.
\item $(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \dots, X_{i3}, u_{i1}, \dots, u_{iT})$, $i=1,\dots,n$ are i.i.d. draws from their joint distribution.
\item Large outliers are unlikely i.e. $(X_{it}, u_{it})$ have nonzero finite fourth moments.
\item There is no perfect multicollinearity.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

When there are multiple regressors, $X_{it}$ is replaced by $X_{1,it}, X_{2,it}, \dots, X_{k,it}$.
\end{keyconcepts}

The first assumption is that the error is uncorrelated with \emph{all}
observations of the variable \(X\) for the entity \(i\) over time. If
this assumption is violated, we face omitted variables bias. The second
assumption ensures that variables are i.i.d. \emph{across} entities
\(i=1,\dots,n\). Notice that this does not require the observations to
be uncorrelated \emph{within} an entity. We say that the \(X_{it}\) are
allowed to be \emph{autocorrelated} or \emph{serially correlated} within
entities. This is a common property of time series data. The same is
allowed for errors \(u_{it}\). Consult Chapter \ref{tferaaseffer} of the
book for a detailed explanation for why autocorrelation is a plausible
characteristic in panel applications. The second assumption is granted
if the entities are selected by simple random sampling. The third and
fourth assumptions are analogous to the multiple regression assumptions
made in Key Concept 6.4.

\subsubsection*{Standard Errors for Fixed Effects
Regression}\label{standard-errors-for-fixed-effects-regression}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Standard Errors for Fixed Effects
Regression}

Similar as for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation invalidates the usual
standard error formulas and also alters the way
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors must be computed since these
are derived under the assumption that there is no autocorrelation. In
the context of heteroskedasticity \emph{and} autocorrelation so-called
\emph{heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard
errors} need to be used. \emph{Clustered standard errors} belong to
these type of standard errors. They allow for heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelated errors within an entity but \emph{not} for any kind of
correlation across entities.

As shown in the examples throughout this chapter, it is fairly easy to
specify usage of clustered standard errors in regression summaries
produced by function like \texttt{coeftest()} in conjunction with
\texttt{vcovHC()} from the package \texttt{sandwich}. Conveniently,
\texttt{vcovHC()} recognizes panel model objects (objects of class
\texttt{plm}) and computes clustered standard errors by default.

The regressions conducted in this chapter are a good examples for why
usage of clustered standard errors is crucial in empirical applications
of fixed effects models. For example, consider the entity and time fixed
effects regression model for fatalities. Since
\texttt{fatal\_tefe\_lm\_mod} is an object of class \texttt{lm},
\texttt{coeftest()} does not compute clustered standard errors but uses
robust standard errors that are only valid in the absence of
autocorrelated errors.

The outcomes deviate rather strongly: imposing no autocorrelation we
obtain a standard error of \(0.25\) which implies significance of
\(\beta_1\), the coefficient on \(BeerTax\) at the level of \(5\%\). On
the contrary, using the clustered standard error (\(0.35\)) leads to
acceptance of the hypothesis \(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\) at the same level of
significance, see equation \eqref{eq:cbnfemod}. Consult Appendix 10.2 of
the book for insights on the computation of clustered standard errors.

\section{Drunk Driving Laws and Traffic
Deaths}\label{drunk-driving-laws-and-traffic-deaths}

There are two major sources of omitted variable bias that are not
accounted for by all of the models of the relation between traffic
fatalities and beer taxes that we have considered so far: economic
conditions and driving laws. Fortunately, \texttt{Fatalities} has
recordings on state specific legal drinking age (\texttt{drinkage}),
punishment (\texttt{jail}, \texttt{service}) and various economic
indicators like unemployment rate (\texttt{unemp}) and per capita income
(\texttt{income}). We may use this data to extend the preceding
analysis.

At first, we define the variables according to the regression results
presented in Table 10.1 of the book.

While columns (2) and (3) recap the results \eqref{eq:efemod} and
\eqref{eq:cbnfemod}, column (1) presents an estimate of the coefficient of
interest in the naive OLS regression of the fatality rate on beer tax
without any fixed effects. We obtain a \emph{positive} estimate for the
coefficient on beer tax that is likely to be upward biased. Notice that
the model fit is rather bad, too (\(\overline{R^2} = 0.091\)). The sign
of the estimate changes as we extend the model by both entity and time
fixed effects in models (2) and (3). Furthermore \(\overline{R^2}\)
increases substantially as fixed effects are included in the model
equation. Nonetheless, as discussed before, the magnitudes of both
estimates are by far too large.

Thus, model specifications (4) to (7) include covariates that shall
capture the effect of overall state economic conditions as well as the
legal framework. These covariates are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{unemp}: a numeric variable stating the state specific
  unemployment rate.
\item
  \texttt{log(income)}: the logarithm of real per capita income (in
  prices of 1988).
\item
  \texttt{miles}: average miles per driver.
\item
  \texttt{drinkage}: state specify minimum legal drinking age.
\item
  \texttt{drinkagc}: a discretized version of \texttt{drinkage} that
  classifies states into four categories of minimal drinking age;
  \(18\), \(19\), \(20\), \(21\) and older. \texttt{R} denotes this as
  \texttt{[18,19)}, \texttt{[19,20)}, \texttt{[20,21)} and
  \texttt{[21,22]}. These categories are included as dummy regressors
  whereby \texttt{[21,22]} is chosen to be the reference category.
\item
  \texttt{punish}: a dummy variable with levels \texttt{yes} and
  \texttt{no} that measures if drunk driving is severely punished by
  mandatory jail time or mandatory community service (first conviction).
\end{itemize}

Considering (4) as the base specification, we observe four interesting
results:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Including the covariates does not lead to a major reduction of the
  estimated effect of the beer tax. Plus, the coefficient is not
  significantly different from zero at the level of \(5\%\) as the
  estimate is rather imprecise.
\item
  The minimum legal drinking age \emph{does not} have an effect on
  traffic fatalities: none of the three dummy variables are
  significantly different from zero at any level of significance common
  in practice. Moreover, an \(F\)-Test of the joint hypothesis that all
  three coefficients are zero does not reject. The next code chunk shows
  how to test this hypothesis.
\end{enumerate}

Model (5) omits the economic factors. The result supports the
presumption that economic indicators should remain part of the model as
the coefficient on beer tax is sensitive to the inclusion of the latter.

Results for model (6) are in favor of the presumption that legal
drinking age has little explanatory power and that the coefficient of
interest is not sensitive to changes in the functional form of the
relation between drinking age and traffic fatalities.

Estimation outcomes for specification (7) reveals that reducing the
amount of available information inflates standard errors but does not
lead to drastic changes in coefficient estimates.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

We have not found evidence that menacing severe punishments and
increasing the minimum drinking age are appropriate measures for
reducing traffic fatalities due to drunk driving. Nonetheless we
concluded that there is some effect of alcohol taxes on traffic
fatalities which, however, is estimated imprecisely and cannot be
interpreted as the causal effect of interest as there seems to be
omitted variable bias. This bias persists even though we used a panel
approach that controls for entity specific and time invariant
unobservables. A possible source for this bias are omitted variables
that change across entities \emph{and} over time.

A powerful method that can be used if common panel regression approaches
fail is instrumental variables regression. We will return to this
concept in Chapter \ref{ivr}.

\chapter{Regression with a Binary Dependent Variable}\label{rwabdv}

In this chapter, we discuss a special class of regression models that
aims to explain a limited dependent variable by multiple regressors.

In particular, we consider models where the dependent variable is
binary. We will see that in such models, the regression function can be
interpreted as a conditional probability function of the binary
dependent variable.

We review the following concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The linear probability model
\item
  The Probit model
\item
  The Logit model
\item
  Maximum likelihood estimation of nonlinear regression models
\end{itemize}

Of course, we will also see how to estimate abovementioned models using
\texttt{R} and discuss an application where we examine the question
whether there is racial discrimination in the U.S. mortgage market.

The following packages and their dependencies are needed for
reproduction of the code chunks presented throughout this chapter on
your computer:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{AER} \citep{R-AER}
\item
  \texttt{stargazer} \citep{R-stargazer}
\end{itemize}

Check whether the following code chunk runs without any errors.

\section{Binary Dependent Variables and the Linear Probability
Model}\label{binary-dependent-variables-and-the-linear-probability-model}

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Linear Probability Model]{11.1}
The linear regression model 
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + u_i$$
with a binary dependent variable $Y_i$ is called the linear probability model. In the linear probability model we have $$E(Y\vert X_1,X_2,\dots,X_k) = P(Y=1\vert X_1, X_2,\dots, X_3)$$ such that $$ P(Y = 1 \vert X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki}.$$

Thus, the coefficient $\beta_j$ can be interpreted as the change in the probability that $Y_i=1$, holding constant the other $k-1$ regressors. Just as in common multiple regression, the $\beta_j$ can be estimated using OLS and the robust standard error formulas can be used for hypothesis testing and computation of confidence intervals.\newline 

In most linear probability models, $R^2$ has no meaningful interpretation since the regression line can never fit the data perfectly if the dependent variable is binary and the regressors are continuous. This can be seen in the application below.\newline

We emphasize that it is \textit{essential} to use robust standard errors since the $u_i$ in a linear probability model are always heteroskedastic.\newline

Linear probability models are easily estimated in \texttt{R} using the function \texttt{lm()}.

The variable we are interested in modelling is \texttt{deny}, an
indicator for whether an applicants mortgage application has been
accepted (\texttt{deny = no}) or denied (\texttt{deny = yes}). A
regressors that can be presumed to have power in explaining whether a
mortgage application has been denied or accepted is \texttt{pirat}, the
size of the anticipated total monthly loan payments relative to the the
applicant's income. It is straightforward to translate this into the
simple regression model

\begin{align}
  deny = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P/I\ ratio + u. \label{eq:denymod1}
\end{align}

We can estimate this model just as any other linear regression model
using \texttt{lm()}. Before we do so, the variable \texttt{deny} must be
converted to a numeric variable using \texttt{as.numeric()}. Note that
\texttt{as.numeric(HMDA\textbackslash{}\$deny)} will turn
\texttt{deny = no} into \texttt{deny = 1} and \texttt{deny = yes} into
\texttt{deny = 2}, so using \texttt{as.numeric(HMDA\$deny)-1} we obtain
the values \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}.

We observe that, according to the estimated model equation, a
payment-to-income ratio of \(1\) is associated with an expected
probability of mortgage application denial of roughly \(50\%\). The
model indicates that there is a positive relation between the
payment-to-income ratio and the probability of a denied mortgage
application so individuals with a high ratio of loan payments to income
are more likely to be rejected.

We may use \texttt{coeftest()} to obtain robust standard errors for both
coefficient estimates.

The estimated regression line is
\[\widehat{deny} = -\underset{(0.032)}{0.080} + \underset{(0.098)}{0.604} P/I \ ratio.\]
The true coefficient on \(P/I \ ratio\) is statistically different from
\(0\) at the \(1\%\) level. Its estimate can be interpreted as follows:
a \(1\%\) increase in \(P/I \ ratio\) leads to an increase in the
probability of a loan denial by
\(0.604 * 0.01 = 0.00604 \approx 0.6\%\).

Following the book we augment the simple model \eqref{eq:denymod1} by an
additional regressor \(black\) which equals \(1\) if the applicant is an
African American and equals \(0\) if the applicant is white. Such a
specification is the baseline for investigation of the question whether
there is racial discrimination in the mortgage market: if being black
has a significant (positive) influence on the probability of a loan
denial when we control for factors that allow for an objective
assessment of an applicants credit worthiness, this is an indicator for
discrimination.

So the estimated regression function is

\begin{align}
  \widehat{deny} =& \, -\underset{(0.029)}{0.091} + \underset{(0.089)}{0.559} P/I \ ratio + \underset{(0.025)}{0.177} black. \label{eq:denymod2}
\end{align}

The coefficient on \(black\) is positive and significantly different
from zero at the \(0.01\%\) level. The interpretation is that, holding
constant the \(P/I \ ratio\), being black increases the probability of a
mortgage application denial by about \(17.7\%\). This suggests racial
discrimination. However, this result might be distorted by omitted
variable bias so this could be a premature conclusion.

\section{Probit and Logit Regression}\label{probit-and-logit-regression}

The linear probability model has a major flaw: it assumes the
conditional probability function to be linear. This does not restrict
the probability of observing \(Y=1\) conditional on some regressor to
lie between \(0\) and \(1\). We can easily see this in our reproduction
of Figure 11.1 of the book: for \(P/I \ ratio \geq 1.75\), model
\eqref{eq:denymod1} predicts the probability of a mortgage application
denial to be bigger than \(1\). For applications with \(P/I \ ratio\)
close to \(0\), the predicted probability of denial is even negative so
the model has no meaningful interpretation here.

This circumstance demands for an approach that use a \emph{nonlinear}
function to model the conditional probability function of a binary
dependent variable. Commonly used methods are Probit and Logit
regression.

\subsection*{Probit Regression}\label{probit-regression}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Probit Regression}

In Probit regression, the cumulative standard normal distribution
function \(\Phi\) is used to model the regression function when the
dependent variable is binary, that is we assume

\begin{align}
  E(Y\vert X) = P(Y=1\vert X) = \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X). \label{eq:probitmodel}
\end{align}

\(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X\) in \eqref{eq:probitmodel} plays the role of a
quantile \(z\). Remember that
\[\Phi(z) = P(Z \leq z) \ , \ Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1).\] such that the
Probit coefficient \(\beta_1\) in \eqref{eq:probitmodel} is the change in
\(z\) associated with a one unit change in \(X\). Note that, although
the effect on \(z\) of a change in \(X\) is linear, the link between
\(z\) and the dependent variable \(Y\) is nonlinear since \(\Phi\) is a
nonlinear function of \(X\).

Since in Probit models the dependent variable is a nonlinear function of
the regressors, the coefficient on \(X\) has no simple interpretation.
According to Key Concept 8.1, the expected change in the probability
that \(Y=1\) due to a change in \(P/I \ ratio\) can be computed in the
following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute the predicted probability that \(Y=1\) for the original value
  of \(X\).
\item
  Compute the predicted probability that \(Y=1\) for \(X + \Delta X\).
\item
  Compute the difference between both predicted probabilities.
\end{enumerate}

Of course we can generalize \eqref{eq:probitmodel} to Probit regression
with multiple regressors to mitigate the risk of facing omitted variable
bias. The core knowledge on Probit regression is summarized in Key
Concept 11.2.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Probit Model, Predicted Probabilities and Estimated Effects]{11.2}
Assume that $Y$ is a binary variable. The model

$$ Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1 + X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k + u $$
with
$$P(Y = 1 \vert X_1, X_2, \dots ,X_k) = \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 + X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k)$$
is the population Probit model with multiple regressors where $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k$ are regressors and $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.\newline

The predicted probability that $Y=1$ given $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k$ can be calculated in two steps:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k$
\item Look up $\Phi(z)$ using a normal distribution table or by calling \texttt{pnorm()}.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

$\beta_j$ is the effect on $z$ of a one unit change in regressor $X_j$, holding constant all other $k-1$ regressors.\newline

The effect on the predicted probability of a change in a regressor can be computed as shown in Key Concept 8.1.\newline

In \texttt{R}, Probit models can be estimated using the function \texttt{glm()} from the package \texttt{stats}. Using the argument \texttt{family} we specify that we want to use a Probit link function.
\end{keyconcepts}

We now estimate a simple Probit model of the probability of a mortgage
denial.

The estimated model equation is

Just as in the linear probability model we find that the relation
between the probability of denial and the payments-to-income ratio is
positive and that the corresponding coefficient is highly significant.

Notice that the estimated regression function has a stretched
``S''-shape which is typical for the CDF of a of continuous random
variable with symmetric PDF like that of a normally distributed random
variable. The function is clearly nonlinear and flattens out for large
and small values of \(P/I \ ratio\). More importantly, the functional
form ensures that the predicted conditional probabilities of a denial
lie between \(0\) and \(1\).

We may use \texttt{predict()} to compute the predicted change in the
denial probability when \(P/I \ ratio\) is increased from \(0.3\) to

approximately \(6.2\%\).

While all coefficients are highly significant, both the estimated
coefficients on the payments-to-income ratio and the indicator for
African American descent are positive. Again, the coefficients are
difficult to interpret but they indicate that first, African Americans
have a higher probability of denial than white applicants do, holding
constant the payments-to-income ratio and second, applicants with a high
payments-to-income ratio face a higher risk of being rejected.

How big is the estimated difference in denial probabilities between two
hypothetical applicants with the same payments-to-income ratio? As

\subsection*{Logit Regression}\label{logit-regression}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Logit Regression}

Key Concept 11.3 summarizes the main differences between Logit and
Probit regression.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Logit Regression]{11.3}
The population Logit regression function is

\begin{align*}
  P(Y=1\vert X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k) =& \, F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k) \\
  =& \, \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k)}}.
\end{align*}

The idea is similar to Probit regression except that a different CDF is used: $$F(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$ is the CDF of a standard logistically distributed random variable.
\end{keyconcepts}

As for Probit regression, there is no simple interpretation of the model
coefficients and it is best to consider predicted probabilities or
differences in predicted probabilities. Here again, \(t\)-statistics and
confidence intervals based on large sample normal approximations can be
computed as usual.

It is fairly easy to estimate a Logit regression model using \texttt{R}.

\subsubsection*{Comparison of the
Models}\label{comparison-of-the-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Comparison of the Models}

The Probit model and the Logit model deliver only approximations to the
unknown population regression function \(E(Y\vert X)\). It is not
unambiguous to decide which model one should use in practice. The linear
probability model has the clear drawback of not being able to capture
the nonlinear nature of the population regression function and it
predicts probabilities to lie outside the interval \([0,1]\) for extreme
regressor values. Probit and Logit models are harder to interpret but
can capture the nonlinearities better than the linear approach: both
models produce predictions of probabilities that lie inside the interval
\([0,1]\). Predictions of Probit and Logit models are often close to
each other. The book suggests to use the method that is easiest to use
in the statistical software of choice. As we have seen, it is equally
easy to estimate Probit and Logit model using \texttt{R}. We can
therefore give no general recommendation which method to use.

\section{Estimation and Inference in the Logit and Probit
Models}\label{estimation-and-inference-in-the-logit-and-probit-models}

So far nothing has been said about \emph{how} Logit and Probit models
are estimated by statistical software. The reason why this is
interesting is that both models are \emph{nonlinear in the parameters}
and thus cannot be estimated using OLS. Instead one relies on a method
called \emph{maximum likelihood estimation} (MLE). Another approach is
estimation by \emph{nonlinear least squares} (NLS).

\subsubsection*{Nonlinear Least Squares}\label{nonlinear-least-squares}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Nonlinear Least Squares}

Consider the multiple regression Probit model

\begin{align}
  E(Y_i\vert X_{1i}, \dots, X_{ki}) = P(Y_i=1\vert X_{1i}, \dots, X_{ki}) = \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki}). \label{eq:multprobit}
\end{align}

Similarly to OLS, NLS estimates the parameters
\(\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k\) by minimizing the sum of squared
mistakes
\[\sum_{i=1}^n\left[ Y_i - \Phi(b_0 + b_1 X_{1i} + \dots + b_k X_{ki}) \right]^2.\]
NLS estimation is a consistent approach that produces estimates which
are normally distributed in large samples. In \texttt{R} there are
functions like \texttt{nls()} from package \texttt{stats} which provide
algorithms for solving nonlinear least squares problems. However, NLS is
inefficient, meaning that there are estimation techniques that have a
smaller variance which is why we will not dwell any further on this
topic.

\subsubsection*{Maximum Likelihood
Estimation}\label{maximum-likelihood-estimation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

In MLE we seek to estimate the unknown parameters choosing them such
that the likelihood of drawing the sample observed is maximized. This
probability is measured by means the likelihood function, the joint
probability distribution of the data treated as a function of the
unknown parameters. Put differently, the maximum likelihood estimates of
the unknown parameters are the values that result in a model which is
most likely to produce the data observed. It turns out that MLE is more
efficient than NLS.

As maximum likelihood estimates are normally distributed in large
samples, statistical inference for coefficients in nonlinear models like
Logit and Probit regression can be made using the same tools that are
used for linear regression models: we can compute \(t\)-statistics and
confidence intervals.

Many software packages use an MLE algorithm for estimation of nonlinear
models. The function \texttt{glm()} uses an algorithm named
\emph{iteratively reweighted least squares}.

\subsubsection*{Measures of Fit}\label{measures-of-fit-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Measures of Fit}

It is important to be aware that the usual \(R^2\) and
\(\overline{R^2}\) are \emph{invalid} for nonlinear regression models.
The reason for this is simple: both measures are derived under the
assumption that the relation between the dependent and the explanatory
variable(s) is linear. This obviously does not hold for Probit and Logit
models thus \(R^2\) does not fall between \(0\) and \(1\) and there is
no meaningful interpretation. However, statistical software sometimes
reports these measures anyway.

There are many measures of fit for nonlinear regression models and there
is no consensus which one should be reported. The situation is even more
complicated because there is no measure of fit that is generally
applicable. For models with a binary response variable like \(deny\) one
could use the following rule: \newline If \(Y_i = 1\) and
\(\widehat{P(Y_i|X_{i1}, \dots, X_{ik})} > 0.5\) or if \(Y_i = 0\) and
\(\widehat{P(Y_i|X_{i1}, \dots, X_{ik})} < 0.5\), consider the \(Y_i\)
as correctly predicted. Otherwise \(Y_i\) is said to be incorrectly
predicted. The measure of fit is the share of correctly predicted
observations. The downside of such an approach is that it does not yield
information on the quality of the prediction.\footnote{Note that this is
  in contrast to the case of a numeric dependent variable where we use
  the squared errors for assessment of the quality of the prediction.}

An alternative to the latter are so called pseudo-\(R^2\) measures. In
order to measure the quality of the fit, these measures compare the
value of the maximized (log-)likelihood of the model with all regressors
(the \emph{full model}) to the likelihood of a model with no regressors
(\emph{null model}, regression on a constant).

For example, consider a Probit regression. The \(\text{pseudo-}R^2\) is
given by
\[\text{pseudo-}R^2 = 1 - \frac{\ln(f^{max}_{full})}{\ln(f^{max}_{null})}\]
where \(f^{max}_j \in [0,1]\) denotes the maximized likelihood for model
\(j\).

The reasoning behind this is that the maximized likelihood increases as
additional regressors are added to the model, similarly to the decrease
in \(SSR\) when regressors are added in a linear regression model. If
the full model has a similar maximized likelihood than the null model,
the full model does not really improve upon a model that uses only the
information in the dependent variable, so
\(\text{pseudo-}R^2 \approx 0\). If the full model fits the data very
good, the maximized likelihood should be close to \(1\) such that
\(\ln(f^{max}_{full}) \approx 0\) and \(\text{pseudo-}R^2 \approx 1\).
See Appendix 11.2 of the book for more on MLE and pseudo-\(R^2\)
measures.

\texttt{summary()} does not report \(\text{pseudo-}R^2\) for models
estimated by \texttt{glm()} but we can use the entries \emph{residual
deviance} (\texttt{deviance}) and \emph{null deviance}
(\texttt{null.deviance}) instead. These are computed as
\[\text{deviance} = -2 \times \left[\ln(f^{max}_{saturated}) - \ln(f^{max}_{full}) \right]\]
and

\[\text{null deviance} = -2 \times \left[\ln(f^{max}_{saturated}) - \ln(f^{max}_{null}) \right]\]
where \(f^{max}_{saturated}\) is the maximized likelihood for a model
which assumes that each observation has its own parameter (there are
\(n+1\) parameters to be estimated which leads to a perfect fit). For
models wit ah binary dependent variable, it holds that
\[\text{pseudo-}R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{deviance}}{\text{null deviance}} = 1- \frac{\ln(f^{max}_{full})}{\ln(f^{max}_{null})}.\]

We now compute the \(\text{pseudo-}R^2\) for the augmented Probit model
of mortgage denial.

Another way to obtain the \(\text{pseudo-}R^2\) is to estimate the null

\section{Application to the Boston HMDA
Data}\label{application-to-the-boston-hmda-data}

Models \eqref{eq:denyprobit2} and \eqref{eq:denylogit2} indicate that denial
rates are higher for African American applicants holding constant
payment-to-income ratio. Both results could be wrong due to omitted
variable bias. In order to obtain a more trustworthy estimate of the
effect of being black on the probability of a mortgage application
denial we estimate a linear probability model as well as several Logit
and Probit models. We thereby control for financial variables and
additional applicant characteristics which are likely to influence the
probability of denial and differ between black and white applicants.

Sample averages as shown in Table 11.1 of the book can be easily
reproduced using the functions \texttt{mean()} (as usual for numeric
variables) and \texttt{prop.table()} (for factor variables).

See Chapter 11.4 of the book or use \texttt{R}'s help function for more
info on variables contained in the \texttt{HMDA} data set.

Before estimating the models we transform the loan-to-value ratio
(\texttt{lvrat}) into a factor variable, where

\begin{align*}
  lvrat = 
  \begin{cases}
    \text{low} & \text{if} \ \ lvrat < 0.8, \\
    \text{medium} & \text{if} \ \ 0.8 \leq lvrat \leq 0.95, \\
    \text{high} & \text{if} \ \ lvrat > 0.95
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

and convert both credit scores to numeric variables.

In Table \ref{tab:hmdad}, models (1), (2) and (3) are base
specifications that include several financial control variables. They
differ only in the way they model the denial probability. Model (1) is a
linear probability model, model (2) is a Logit regression and model (3)
uses the Probit approach.

Since model (1) is a linear model, the coefficients have direct
interpretation. For example, an increase in the consumer credit score by
\(1\) unit is estimated to increase the probability of a loan denial by
about \(0.031\) percentage points. We also find that having a high
loan-to-value ratio is predicted not to be conductive for credit
approval: the coefficient for a loan-to-value ratio higher than \(0.95\)
is \(0.189\) so clients with this property are estimated to face an
almost \(19\%\) larger risk of denial than those with a low
loan-to-value ratio, ceteris paribus. For the linear probability model,
the coefficient on the race dummy is estimated to be \(0.084\) which
indicates the denial probability for African Americans is \(8.4\%\)
larger than for white applicants with the same characteristics except
for race. Apart from housing expense-to-income ratio and the mortgage
credit score, all coefficients are significant.

Models (2) and (3) provide similar evidence that there is racial
discrimination in the U.S. mortgage market. All coefficients except for
housing expense-to-income ratio (which is not significantly different
from zero) are significant at the \(1\%\) level. As discussed above, the
nonlinearity makes the interpretation of the coefficient estimates more
difficult than for model (1). In order to make a statement about the
effect of being black, we need to compute the estimated denial
probability for two individuals that differ only in race. For the
comparison we consider two individuals that share mean values for all
numeric regressors. For all qualitative variables we assign the property
that is the most representative for the data at hand. As an example,
consider self-employment: we have seen that about \(88\%\) of all
individuals in the sample are not self-employed such that we set
\texttt{selfemp = no}. Using this approach, the estimate for the effect
on the denial probability of being African American obtained using the
Logit model (2) is about \(4\%\). The next code chunk shows how to apply
this approach for models (1) to (7) using \texttt{R}.

The estimates of the impact on the denial probability of being black are
similar for models (2) and (3). In particular, it is interesting that
the magnitude of the estimated effects is much smaller than for Probit
and Logit models that do not control for financial characteristics (see
section 11.2). This indicates that these simple models produce biased
estimates due to omitted variables.

Regressions (4) to (6) use regression specifications that include
different sets of applicant characteristics and credit rating indicator
variables as well as interactions. However, most of the corresponding
coefficients are not significant and the estimates of the coefficient on
\texttt{black} obtained for these models as well as the estimated
difference in denial probabilities do not deviate much from those
obtained for the similar specifications (2) and (3).

An interesting question related to racial discrimination can be
investigated using the Probit model (6) where the interactions
\texttt{blackyes:pirat} and \texttt{blackyes:hirat} are added to the the
specification of model (4). If the coefficient on
\texttt{blackyes:pirat} was different from zero, the effect of the
payment-to-income ratio on the denial probability would be different for
black and white applicants. Similarly, a non-zero coefficient on
\texttt{blackyes:hirat} would indicate that loan officers weight the
risk of bankrupt associated with a high loan-to-value ratio differently
for black and white mortgage applicants. We can test whether these
coefficients are jointly significant at the \(5\%\) level using an
\(F\)-Test.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-3}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

Models (1) to (6) provide evidence that there is an effect of being
African American on the probability of a mortgage application denial: in
all specifications, the effect is estimated to be positive (ranging from
\(4\%\) to \(5\%\) for the fictive individuals considered) and is
significantly different from zero at the \(1\%\) level. While the linear
probability model seems to overestimate this effect slightly, it still
can be used as an approximation to an intrinsic nonlinear relationship.

See Chapters 11.4 and 11.5 of the book for a discussion of external and
internal validity of this study and some concluding remarks on
regression models where the dependent variable is binary.

\chapter{Instrumental Variables Regression}\label{ivr}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{asbomr}, regression models may suffer from
problems like omitted variables, measurement errors and simultaneous
causality. If so, the error term is correlated with the regressor of
interest and there is a bias in estimation of the corresponding
coefficient. So far we have assumed that we can add the omitted
variables to the regression to mitigate the risk of biased estimation of
the causal effect of interest. However, if omitted factors cannot be
measured or are not available for other reasons, multiple regression
cannot solve the problem. The same issue arises if there is simultaneous
causality. When causality runs from \(X\) to \(Y\) and vice versa, there
will be an estimation bias that cannot be corrected for by multiple
regression.

A general technique for obtaining a consistent estimate of the
coefficient of interest is instrumental variables (IV) regression. In
this chapter we focus on a powerful IV regression tool called
\emph{two-stage least squares} (TSLS). The first sections briefly recap
the general mechanics and assumptions of IV regression and show how to
perform TSLS estimation using \texttt{R}. Next, IV regression is used
for estimating the elasticity of the demand for cigarettes --- a
classical example where multiple regression fails to do the job because
of simultaneous causality.

Just like for the previous chapter, the packages \texttt{AER}
\citep{R-AER} and \texttt{stargazer} \citep{R-stargazer} are required
for reproducing the code presented in this chapter. Check whether the
code chunk below executes without any error messages.

\section{The IV Estimator with a Single Regressor and a Single
Instrument}\label{TIVEWASRAASI}

Consider the simple regression model

\begin{align}
  Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n  \label{eq:srm12}
\end{align}

where the error term \(u_i\) is correlated with the regressor \(X_i\)
(we say that \(X\) is \emph{endogenous}) such that OLS is inconsistent
for the true \(\beta_1\). In the most simple case, IV regression uses a
single instrumental variable \(Z\) to obtain a consistent estimator for
\(\beta_1\).

\(Z\) must satisfy two conditions to be a valid instrument:

\textbf{1. Instrument relevance condition}:

\(X\) and its instrument \(Z\) \emph{must be} correlated:
\(\rho_{Z_i,X_i} \neq 0\).

\textbf{2. Instrument exogeneity condition}:

The instrument \(Z\) \emph{must not be} correlated with the error term
\(u\): \(\rho_{Z_i,u_i} = 0\).

\subsubsection*{The Two-Stage Least Squares
Estimator}\label{the-two-stage-least-squares-estimator}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{The Two-Stage Least Squares
Estimator}

As can be guessed from its name, TSLS has two stages. In the first
stage, the variation in the endogenous regressor \(X\) is decomposed
into a problem-free component that is explained by the instrument \(Z\)
and a problematic component that is correlated with the error \(u_i\).
The second stage uses the problem-free component of the variation in
\(X\) to estimate \(\beta_1\).

The first stage regression model is \[X_i = \pi_0 + \pi_1 Z_i + \nu_i,\]
where \(\pi_0 + \pi_1 Z_i\) is the component of \(X_i\) that is
explained by \(Z_i\) while \(\nu_i\) is the component that cannot be
explained by \(Z_i\) and exhibits correlation with \(u_i\).

Using the OLS estimates \(\widehat{\pi}_0\) and \(\widehat{\pi}_1\) we
obtain predicted values \(\widehat{X}_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n\). If
\(Z\) is a valid instrument, the \(\widehat{X}_i\) are problem-free in
the sense that \(\widehat{X}\) is exogenous in a regression of \(Y\) on
\(\widehat{X}\) which is done in the second stage regression. The second
stage produces \(\widehat{\beta}_0^{TSLS}\) and
\(\widehat{\beta}_1^{TSLS}\), the TSLS estimates of \(\beta_0\) and
\(\beta_1\).

For the case of a single instrument one can show that the TSLS estimator
of \(\beta_1\) is

\begin{align}
\widehat{\beta}_1^{TSLS} = \frac{s_{ZY}}{s_{ZX}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \overline{Y})(Z_i - \overline{Z})}{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \overline{X})(Z_i - \overline{Z})}, \label{eq:simpletsls}
\end{align}

which is nothing but the ratio of the sample covariance between \(Z\)
and \(Y\) to the sample covariance between \(Z\) and \(X\).

As shown in Appendix 12.3 of the book, \eqref{eq:simpletsls} is a
consistent estimator for \(\beta_1\) in \eqref{eq:srm12} under the
assumption that \(Z\) is a valid instrument. Just as for every other OLS
estimator we have considered so far, the CLT implies that the
distribution of \(\widehat{\beta}_1^{TSLS}\) can be approximated by a
normal distribution if the sample size is large. This allows us to use
\(t\)-statistics and confidence intervals which are also computed by the
\texttt{R} functions relevant to us. A more detailed argument on the
large-sample distribution of the TSLS estimator is sketched in Appendix
12.3 of the book.

\subsubsection*{Application to the Demand For
Cigarettes}\label{application-to-the-demand-for-cigarettes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Application to the Demand For
Cigarettes}

The relation between the demand for and the price of commodities is a
simple yet widespread problem in many branches of economics. The field
of health economics is inter alia concerned with the study of how
health-affecting behavior of individuals is influenced by the
health-care system and regulation policy. The probably most prominent
example in public policy debates is smoking as it is related to numerous
illnesses and negative externalities.

It is plausible that cigarette consumption can be reduced by taxing
cigarettes more heavily. The question is \emph{how much} taxes must be
increased to reach a noticeable reduction in cigarette consumption.
Economists use elasticities to answer this kind of question. Since the
price elasticity for the demand of cigarettes is unknown, it must be
estimated. As discussed in the box \emph{Who Invented Instrumental
Variables Regression} presented in Chapter 12.1 of the book, an OLS
regression of log quantity on log price cannot be used to estimate the
effect of interest since there is simultaneous causality between demand
and supply. Instead, IV regression can be used.

We use the data set \texttt{CigarettesSW} which comes with the package
\texttt{AER}. It is a panel data set that contains observations on
cigarette consumption and several economic indicators for all 48
continental federal states of the U.S. from 1985 to 1995. Following the
book we consider data for the cross section of states in 1995 only.

We start by loading the package, attaching the data set and getting an
overview.

Use \texttt{?CigarettesSW} for a detailed description of the variables.

We are interested in estimating \(\beta_1\) in

\begin{align}
  \log(Q_i^{cigarettes}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(P_i^{cigarettes}) + u_i, \label{eq:cigstsls}
\end{align}

where \(Q_i^{cigarettes}\) is the number of cigarette packs per capita
sold and \(P_i^{cigarettes}\) is the after tax average real price per
pack of cigarettes in state \(i\).

The variable we are going to use for instrumenting the endogenous
variable \(\log(P_i^{cigarettes})\) is \(SalesTax\), the portion of
taxes on cigarettes arising from the general sales tax. \(SalesTax\) is
measured in dollars per pack. The idea is that \(SalesTax\) is a
relevant instrument as it is included in the after tax average price per
pack. Also it is plausible that \(SalesTax\) is exogenous since the
sales tax does not influence to quantity sold directly but indirectly
through the price.

Before computing the TSLS estimate for \(\beta_1\) we have to do some
transformations in order to obtain deflated cross section data for the
year 1995.

We also compute the sample correlation between the sales tax and price
per pack. Notice that the sample correlation is a consistent estimator
of the population correlation. The estimate of approximately \(0.614\)
indicates that \(SalesTax\) and \(P_i^{cigarettes}\) exhibit moderately
positive correlation which is in accordance with our expectations:
higher sales taxes lead to higher prices. However, a correlation
analysis like this is not sufficient for checking whether the instrument
is relevant. We will later come back to the issue of checking weather an
instrument is relevant and exogenous.

For the first stage regression we obtain
\[\widehat{\log(P_i^{cigarettes})} = \underset{(0.03)}{4.62} + \underset{(0.005)}{0.031} SalesTax_i\]
which predicts the relation between sales tax price per cigarettes to be
positive. How much of the observed variation in \(\log(P^{cigarettes})\)
is explained by the instrumental variable \(SalesTax\)? This can be
answered by looking at the regression's \(R^2\) which states that about
\(47\%\) of the variation in after tax prices is explained by the
variation of the sales tax across states.

Thus estimating the model \eqref{eq:cigstsls} using TSLS yields

\begin{align}
  \widehat{\log(Q_i^{cigarettes})} = \underset{(1.70)}{9.72} + \underset{(0.36)}{1.08} \log(P_i^{cigarettes}), \label{eq:ecigstsls}
\end{align}

where we write \(\log(P_i^{cigarettes})\) instead of
\(\widehat{\log(P_i^{cigarettes})}\) for convenience.

The function \texttt{ivreg()} from the package \texttt{AER} carries out
TSLS procedure automatically. It is used similarly as \texttt{lm()}.
Instruments can be added to the usual specification of the regression
formula using a vertical bar separating the model equation from the
instruments. Thus, for the regression at hand the correct formula is
\texttt{log(packs) \textasciitilde{} log(rprice) | salestax}.

We find that the coefficient estimates coincide for both approaches.

\textbf{Two Notes on the Computation of TSLS Standard Errors}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  We have demonstrated that running the individual regressions for each
  stage of TSLS using \texttt{lm()} leads to the same coefficient
  estimates as when using \texttt{ivreg()}. However, the standard errors
  reported for the second-stage regression, e.g.~by \texttt{coeftest()}
  or \texttt{summary()}, are \emph{invalid}: both functions \emph{do
  not} adjust for using predictions from the first-stage regression as
  regressors in the second-stage regression! Fortunately,
  \texttt{ivreg()} performs the necessary adjustment automatically. This
  is another advantage over manual step-by-step estimation which we have
  done above for demonstrating the mechanics of the procedure.
\item
  Just like in multiple regression it is important to compute
  heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors as we have done above using
  \texttt{vcovHC()}.
\end{enumerate}

The TSLS estimate for \(\beta_1\) in \eqref{eq:ecigstsls} suggests that an
increase in cigarette prices by one percent reduces cigarette
consumption by roughly \(1.08\) percentage points which is fairly
elastic. However, we should keep in mind that this estimate might not be
trustworthy although we used IV estimation: there still might be a bias
due to omitted variables. Thus a multiple IV regression approach is
needed.

\section{The General IV Regression Model}\label{TGIVRM}

The simple IV regression model is easily extended to a multiple
regression model which we refer to as the general IV regression model.
In this model we distinguish between four types of variables: the
dependent variable, included exogenous variables, included endogenous
variables and instrumental variables. Key Concept 12.1 summarizes the
model and the common terminology. See Chapter 12.2 of the book for a
more comprehensive discussion of the individual components of the
general model.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The General Instrumental Variables Regression Model and Terminology]{12.1}
\begin{align}
  Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \dots + \beta_k X_{ki} + \beta_{k+1} W_{1i} + \beta_{k+r} W_{ri} + u_i,\label{eq:givmodel}
\end{align}
with $i=1,\dots,n$ is the general instrumental variables regression model where\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item $Y_i$ is the dependent variable
\item $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k$ are $k$ unknown regression coefficients
\item $X_{1i},\dots,X_{ki}$ are $k$ endogenous regressors 
\item $W_{1i},\dots,W_{ri}$ are $r$ exogenous regressors which are uncorrelated with $u_i$
\item $u_i$ is the error term
\item $Z_{1i},\dots,Z_{mi}$ are $m$ instrumental variables
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.5cm}

The coefficients are overidentified if $m>k$ that is if there are more instruments than regressors. If $m<k$, the coefficients are underidentified and when $m=k$ they are exactly identified. For estimation of the IV regression model exact identification or overidentification is required.
\end{keyconcepts}

While computing both stages of TSLS individually is not a big deal in
\eqref{eq:srm12}, the simple regression model with a single endogenous
regressor, Key Concept 12.2 clarifies why resorting to TSLS estimation
functions like \texttt{ivreg()} are much more convenient when the set of
potentially endogenous regressors (and instruments) is large.

Estimating regression models with TSLS using multiple instruments by
means of \texttt{ivreg()} is straightforward. There are, however, some
subtleties when it comes to correct specification of the regression
formula that should be mentioned.

Assume that you want to estimate the model
\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + W_{1i} + u_i\] where
\(X_{1i}\) and \(X_{2i}\) are endogenous regressors that shall be
instrumented by \(Z_{1i}\), \(Z_{2i}\) and \(Z_{3i}\) and \(W_{1i}\) is
an exogenous regressor. The corresponding data is available in a
\texttt{data.frame} with column names \texttt{y}, \texttt{x1},
\texttt{x1},\texttt{w1}, \texttt{z1}, \texttt{z2} and \texttt{z3}. It
might be tempting to specify the argument \texttt{formula} in your call
of \texttt{ivreg()} as
\texttt{y \textasciitilde{} x1 + x2 + w1 | z1 + z2 + z3} which is wrong.
As explained in the documentation of \texttt{ivreg()} (use
\texttt{?ivreg}), it is necessary to list \emph{all} exogenous variables
as instruments too, that is joining them by \texttt{+}'s on the right of
the vertical bar:
\texttt{y \textasciitilde{} x1 + x2 + w1 | w1 + z1 + z2 + z3} where
\texttt{w1} is instrumenting itself.

If there is a large number of exogenous variables it may be convenient
to provide an update formula with a \texttt{.} (this includes all
variables except for the dependent variable) right after the \texttt{|}
and to exclude all endogenous variables using \texttt{-}. Use
\texttt{?iverg} for details on this.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Two-Stage Least Squares]{12.2}
Similarly to the simple IV regression model, the general IV model \ref{eq:givmodel} can be estimated using the TSLS estimator which is computed in two stages:\newline

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{First-stage regression(s)}\newline Run an OLS regression for each of the endogenous variables ($X_{1i},\dots,X_{ki}$) on all instrumental variables ($Z_{1i},\dots,Z_{mi}$) and all exogenous variables ($W_{1i},\dots,W_{ri}$) and an intercept. Compute the fitted values ($\widehat{X}_{1i},\dots,\widehat{X}_{ki}$).\newline 
\item \textbf{Second-stage regression}\newline Regress the dependent variable on the predicted values of all endogenous regressors, all exogenous variables and an intercept using OLS. This delivers $\widehat{\beta}_{0}^{TSLS},\dots,\widehat{\beta}_{k+r}^{TSLS}$, the TSLS estimates of the model coefficients.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

In the general IV regression model the instrument relevance and
instrument exogeneity assumptions are the same as in the simple
regression model with a single endogenous regressor and only one
instrument. See Key Concept 12.3 for a recap using the terminology of
general IV regression.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Two Conditions for Valid Instruments]{12.3}
For $Z_{1i},\dots,Z_{mi}$ to be a set of valid instruments, the following two conditions must be fulfilled:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Instrument Relevance}\newline If there are $k$ endogenous variables, $r$ exogenous variables and $m\geq k$ instruments $Z$ and the $\widehat{X}_{1i}^*,\dots,\widehat{X}_{ki}^*$ are the predicted values from the $k$ population first stage regressions, it must hold that $$(\widehat{X}_{1i}^*,\dots,\widehat{X}_{ki}^*, W_{1i}, \dots, W_{ri},1)$$ are not perfectly multicollinear. $1$ denotes the constant regressor which equals $1$ for all observations.\newline

\textit{Note}: If there is only one endogenous regressor $X_i$, there must be at least one non-zero coefficient on the $Z$ and the $W$ in the population regression for this condition to be valid: if all of the coefficients are zero, all the $\widehat{X}^*_i$ are just the mean of $X$ such that there is perfect multicollinearity.\newline

\item \textbf{Instrument Exogeneity}\newline
All $m$ instruments must be uncorrelated with the error term, $$\rho_{Z_{1i},u_i} = 0,\dots,\rho_{Z_{mi},u_i} = 0.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

One can show that if the IV regression assumptions presented in Key
Concept 12.4 hold, the TSLS estimator in the general IV model
\eqref{eq:givmodel} is consistent and normally distributed when the sample
size is large. To get an idea of the proof for this statement, see
Appendix 12.3 of the book for a discussion of the special case with a
single regressor, a single instrument and no exogenous variables. The
reasoning behind this carries over to the general IV model. A more
complicated explanation for the general case can be found in Chapter 18
of the book.

For our purposes it is sufficient to bear in mind that validity of the
assumptions stated in Key Concept 12.4 allows us to obtain valid
statistical inference using \texttt{R} functions which compute
\(t\)-Tests, \(F\)-Tests and confidence intervals for model
coefficients.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The IV Regression Assumptions]{12.4}
For the general IV regression model in Key Concept 12.1 we assume the following:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item $E(u_i\vert W_{1i}, \dots, W_{ri}) = 0.$
\item $(X_{1i},\dots,X_{ki},W_{1i},\dots,W_{ri},Z_{1i},\dots,Z_{mi})$ are i.i.d. draws from their joint distribution.
\item All variables have nonzero finite fourth moments i.e. outliers are unlikely.
\item The $Z$s are valid instruments (see Key Concept 12.3).
\end{enumerate}

\end{keyconcepts}

\subsubsection*{Application to the Demand for
Cigarettes}\label{application-to-the-demand-for-cigarettes-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Application to the Demand for
Cigarettes}

The estimated elasticity of the demand for cigarettes in \eqref{eq:srm12}
is \(1.08\). Although \eqref{eq:srm12} was estimated using IV regression
it is plausible that this IV estimate is biased: in this model, the TSLS
estimator is inconsistent for the true \(\beta_1\) if the instrument
(the real sales tax per pack) correlates with the error term. This is
likely to be the case since there are economic factors, like e.g.~state
income, which impact the demand for cigarettes and correlate with the
sales tax. States with high personal income tend to generate tax
revenues by income taxes and less by sales taxes. Consequently, state
income should be included in the regression model.

\begin{align}
  \log(Q_i^{cigarettes}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(P_i^{cigarettes}) + \beta_2 \log(income_i) + u_i \label{eq:mcigstsls1}
\end{align}

Before estimating \eqref{eq:mcigstsls1} using \texttt{ivreg()} we define
\(income\) as real per capita income \texttt{rincome} and append it to
the data set \texttt{CigarettesSW}.

Using the two instrumental variables \(salestax_i\) and \(cigtax_i\) we
have \(m=2\) and \(k=1\) so the coefficient on the endogenous regressor
\(\log(P_i^{cigarettes})\) is \emph{overidentified}. The TSLS estimate
of the regression function \eqref{eq:mcigstsls1} is

\begin{align}
  \widehat{\log(Q_i^{cigarettes})} = \underset{(0.96)}{9.89} - \underset{(0.25)}{1.28} \log(P_i^{cigarettes}) + \underset{(0.25)}{0.28} \log(income_i). \label{eq:emcigstsls3}
\end{align}

Should we trust the estimates presented in \eqref{eq:emcigstsls2} or
rather rely on \eqref{eq:emcigstsls3}? Comparing both equations we find
that the estimates obtained using both instruments are more precise
since in \eqref{eq:emcigstsls3} all standard errors reported are smaller
than in \eqref{eq:emcigstsls2}. In fact, the standard error for the
estimate of the demand elasticity is only two thirds of the standard
error when the sales tax is the only instrument used. This is due to
more information being used in estimation \eqref{eq:emcigstsls3}.
\emph{If} the instruments are valid, \eqref{eq:emcigstsls3} can be
considered more reliable.

However, without any inference on validity of both instruments it is not
sensible to make a statement like that. This stresses why checking
instrument validity is essential. Chapter \ref{civ} briefly discusses
guidelines in checking instrument validity and presents approaches that
allow to test for instrument relevance and exogeneity under certain
conditions. These are then used in an application to the demand for
cigarettes in Chapter \ref{attdfc}.

\section{Checking Instrument Validity}\label{civ}

\subsubsection*{Instrument Relevance}\label{instrument-relevance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Instrument Relevance}

Instruments that explain little variation in the endogenous regressor
\(X\) are called \emph{weak instruments}. Weak instruments provide
little information about the variation in \(X\) that is exploited by IV
regression to estimate the effect of interest: the estimate of the
coefficient on the endogenous regressor is estimated inaccurately.
Moreover, weak instruments cause the distribution of the estimator to
deviate considerably from a normal distribution even in large samples
such that the usual methods for obtaining inference about the true
coefficient on \(X\) may produce wrong results. See Chapter 12.3 and
Appendix 12.4 of the book for a more detailed argument on the
undesirable consequences of using weak instruments in IV regression.

\begin{keyconcepts}[A Rule of Thumb for Checking for Weak Instruments]{12.5}
Consider the case of a single endogenous regressor $X$ and $m$ exogenous instruments $Z_1,\dots,Z_m$. If the coefficients on all instruments in the population first-stage regression of a TSLS estimation are zero, the instruments do not explain any of the variation in the $X$ which clearly violates assumption 1 of Key Concept 12.2. Although the latter case is unlikely to be encountered in practice, we should ask ourselves to what extend the assumption of instrument relevance should be fulfilled.\newline 

While this is hard to answer for general IV regression, in the case of a \textit{single} endogenous regressor $X$ one may use the following rule of thumb:\newline

Compute the $F$-statistic which corresponds to the hypothesis that the coefficients on $Z_1,\dots,Z_m$ are all zero in the first-stage regression. If the $F$-statistic is less than $10$, the instruments are weak such that the TSLS estimate of the coefficient on $X$ is biased and no valid statistical inference about its true value can be made. See also Appendix 12.5 of the book.
\end{keyconcepts}

The rule of thumb stated in Key Concept 12.5 is easily implemented in
\texttt{R}. One simply has to run the first-stage regression using
\texttt{lm()} and subsequently compute the heteroskedasticity-robust
\(F\)-statistic by means of \texttt{linearHypothesis()}. This is part of
the application to the demand for cigarettes discussed in Chapter
\ref{attdfc}.

\subsubsection*{If Instruments are Weak}\label{if-instruments-are-weak}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{If Instruments are Weak}

There are two ways to proceed if instruments are weak:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Discard the weak instruments and/or find stronger instruments. While
  the former is only an option if the unknown coefficients remain
  identified when the weak instruments are discarded, the latter can be
  very difficult and even may require a redesign of the whole study.
\item
  Stick with the weak instruments but use methods that improve upon TSLS
  in this scenario, for example limited information maximum likelihood
  estimation, see Appendix 12.5 of the book.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{When the Assumption of Instrument Exogeneity is
Violated}\label{when-the-assumption-of-instrument-exogeneity-is-violated}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{When the Assumption of Instrument
Exogeneity is Violated}

If there is correlation between an instrument and the error term, IV
regression does not produce consistent estimates (this is shown in
Appendix 12.4 of the book). As econometricians, we wish to use the
available information for gaining statistical inference whether an
instrument is exogenous or not. The overidentifying restrictions test
(also called the \(J\)-test) is an approach to test the hypothesis that
\emph{additional} instruments are exogenous under the assumption that
the set of instruments consists of enough valid instruments to identify
the coefficients of interest. For the \(J\)-test to be applicable there
need to be \emph{more} instruments than endogenous regressors. The
\(J\)-test is summarized in Key Concept 12.5.

\begin{keyconcepts}[$J$-Statistic / Overidentifying Restrictions Test]{12.6}
Take $\widehat{u}_i^{TSLS} \ , \ i = 1,\dots,n$, the residuals of the TSLS estimation of the general IV regression model \ref{eq:givmodel}. Run the OLS regression

\begin{align}
  \widehat{u}_i^{TSLS} =& \, \delta_0 + \delta_1 Z_{1i} + \dots + \delta_m Z_{mi} + \delta_{m+1} W_{1i} + \dots + \delta_{m+r} W_{ri} + e_i \label{eq:jstatreg}
\end{align}

and test the joint hypothesis $$H_0: \delta_1 = 0, \dots, \delta_{m} = 0$$ which states that all instruments are exogenous. This can be done using the corresponding $F$-statistic by computing $$J = m  F.$$ This test is the overidentifying restrictions test and the statistic is called the $J$-statistic with $$J \sim \chi^2_{m-k}$$ in large samples under the assumption of homoskedasticity. The degrees of freedom $m-k$ state the degree of overidentification since this is the number of instruments $m$ minus the number of endogenous regressors $k$.
\end{keyconcepts}

It is important to note that the \(J\)-statistic discussed in Key
Concept 12.6 is only \(\chi^2_{m-k}\) distributed when the error term
\(e_i\) in the regression \eqref{eq:jstatreg} is homoskedastic. A
discussion of the heteroskedasticity-robust \(J\)-statistic is beyond
the scope of this chapter. We refer to Section 18.7 of the book for a
theoretical argument.

As for the procedure shown in Key Concept 12.6, further interest lies in
applying the \(J\)-test using the function \texttt{linearHypothesis()}
in \texttt{R}, which will be shown in context of estimation of the
demand elasticity for cigarettes discussed in the next chapter.

\section{Application to the Demand for Cigarettes}\label{attdfc}

Are the general sales tax and the cigarette-specific tax valid
instruments? If not, the TSLS attempt to estimate the demand elasticity
for cigarettes discussed in Chapter \ref{TGIVRM} is not meaningful and
we need to rethink the design of the study. As discussed in Chapter
\ref{TIVEWASRAASI}, both variables are likely to be relevant but whether
they are exogenous is a different question.

In the book it is advocated that cigarette-specific taxes could be
endogenous because there might be state specific historical factors like
economic importance of the tobacco farming and cigarette production
industry that enforces its interest in low cigarette specific taxes.
Since it is plausible that tobacco growing states have higher rates of
smoking than others, this would lead to endogeneity of cigarette
specific taxes. If data about the size on the tobacco and cigarette
industry would be available, we could solve this potential issue by
including the information in the regression. Unfortunately, this is not
the case.

However, since the role of the influence of the tobacco and cigarette
industry is a factor that can be assumed to differ across states but not
over time we may exploit the panel structure of \texttt{CigarettesSW}
instead: as shown in Chapter \ref{PDWTTP}, regression using data on
\emph{changes} between two time periods eliminates such state specific
and time invariant effects. Following the book we consider changes in
variables between 1985 and 1995, that is we are interested in estimating
the \emph{long-run elasticity} of the demand for cigarettes.

The model to be estimated by TSLS using the general sales tax and the
cigarette-specific sales tax as instruments hence is

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  \log(Q_{i,1995}^{cigarettes}) - \log(Q_{i,1995}^{cigarettes}) =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \left[\log(P_{i,1995}^{cigarettes}) - \log(P_{i,1985}^{cigarettes}) \right] \\ +& \beta_2 \left[\log(income_{i,1995}) - \log(income_{i,1985})\right] + u_i. \end{split}\label{eq:diffivreg}
\end{align}

Prior to the estimation using \texttt{ivreg()} we define differences
from 1985 to 1995 for the dependent variable, the regressors and both
instruments.

using \texttt{ivreg()}:

\item
  TSLS using only the difference in the sales taxes between 1985 and

\item
  TSLS using only the difference in the cigarette-specific sales taxes
  1985 and 1995 as the instrument.

In Table \ref{tab:tslseotlteotdfcupd} we observe negative estimates of
the coefficient on \texttt{pricediff} that are quite different in
magnitude. Which one should we trust? This hinges on the validity of
instruments used. To assess this we compute \(F\)-statistics for the
first-stage regressions of all three models to check instrument
relevance.

We also conduct the overidentifying restrictions test for model three
which is the only model where the coefficient on the difference in log
prices is overidentified (\(m=2\), \(k=1\)) such that the
\(J\)-statistic can be computed. To do this we take the residuals stored
in \texttt{cig\_ivreg\_diff3} and regress them on both instruments and
the presumably exogenous regressor \texttt{incomediff}. Yet again we use
\texttt{linearHypothesis()} to test whether the coefficients on both
instruments are zero which is necessary for the exogeneity assumption to
be fulfilled. Note that with \texttt{test = "Chisq"} we obtain a
chi-squared distributed test statistic instead of an \(F\)-statistic.

\textbf{Caution}: in this case the \(p\)-Value reported by
\texttt{linearHypothesis()} is wrong because the degrees of freedom are
set to \(2\). This differs from the degree of overidetification
(\(m-k=2-1=1\)) so the \(J\)-statistic is \(\chi^2_1\) distributed
instead of following a \(\chi^2_2\) distribution as assumed defaultly by
\texttt{linearHypothesis()}. We may compute the correct \(p\)-Value
using \texttt{pchisq()}.

Since this value is smaller than \(0.05\) we reject the hypothesis that
both instruments are exogenous at the level of \(5\%\). This means one
of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The sales tax is an invalid instrument for the per-pack price.
\item
  The cigarettes-specific sales tax is an invalid instrument for the
  per-pack price.
\item
  Both instruments are invalid.
\end{enumerate}

In the book it is argued that the assumption of instrument exogeneity is
more likely to hold for the general sales tax (see Chapter 12.4 of the
book) such that the IV estimate of the long-run elasticity of demand for
cigarettes we consider the most trustworthy is \(-0.94\), the estimate
obtained using TSLS with the general sales tax as the only instrument.

The interpretation of this estimate is that over a 10-year period, an
increase in the average price per package by one percent is expected to
decrease consumption by about \(0.94\) percentage points. This suggests
that, in the long run, price increases can reduce cigarette consumption
considerably.

\section{Where Do Valid Instruments Come
From?}\label{where-do-valid-instruments-come-from}

Chapter 12.5 of the book presents a comprehensive discussion of
approaches to find valid instruments in practice by the example of three
research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Does putting criminals in jail reduce crime?
\item
  Does cutting class sizes increase test scores?
\item
  Does aggressive treatment of heart attacks prolong lives?
\end{itemize}

This section is not directly related to applications in \texttt{R} which
is why we do not discuss the contents here. We encourage you to work
through this on your own.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-4}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

\texttt{ivreg()} from the package \texttt{AER} provides convenient
functionalities to estimate IV regression models in \texttt{R}. It is an
implementation of the TSLS estimation approach.

Besides treating IV estimation, we have also discussed how to test for
weak instruments and how to conduct an overidentifying restrictions test
when there are more instrumental variables than endogenous regressors,
using \texttt{R}.

In an empirical application we have shown how \texttt{ivreg()} can be
used to estimate the long-run elasticity of demand for cigarettes based
on \texttt{CigarettesSW},a panel data set on cigarette consumption and
economic indicators for all 48 continental U.S. states for the time
periods 1985 and 1995. Different sets of instruments were used in the
process and it has been argued why using the general sales tax as the
only instrument is the preferred choice here. The estimate of the demand
elasticity deemed the most trustworthy is \(-0.94\). This estimate
suggests that there is a remarkable negative long-run effect on
cigarette consumption of increasing the average price per pack.

\chapter{Experiments and Quasi-Experiments}\label{eaqe}

This chapter discusses statistical tools that are commonly applied in
program evaluation, which is a field of study where researchers are
interested in measuring the causal effects of programs, policies or
other interventions. An optimal research design for this purpose is what
statisticians call an ideal randomized controlled experiment. The basic
idea is to randomly assign subjects in two different groups, one that
receives the treatment (the treatment group) and one that does not (the
control group) and to compare outcomes for both groups in order to get
an estimate of the average treatment effect.

Note that \emph{experimental} data is fundamentally different from
\emph{observational} data. For example, one might be interested in
measuring how much the performance of students in a standardized test
differs between two classes where one of which has a student-teacher
ratio which is considered regular and the other one has fewer students,
using a randomized controlled experiment. The data produced by such an
experiment would be different from e.g.~the observed cross-section data
on the students' performance used throughout Chapters \ref{lrwor} to
\ref{nrf} where class sizes are not randomly assigned to students but
instead are the results of an economic decision where educational
objectives and budgetary aspects were balanced.

For economists, randomized controlled experiments are often difficult or
even infeasable to implement. For example, due to ethic, moral and legal
reasons it is practically impossible for a business owner to estimate
the causal effect on the productivity of workers of setting them under
psychological stress using an experiment where workers are randomly
assigned either to the treatment group that is pressed under time or to
the control group where work is under regular conditions, at best
without knowledge of being in an experiment.\footnote{See the box
  \emph{The Hawthorne Effect} on p.~528 of the book.}

However sometimes it is the case that external circumstances which
appear random produce what is called a \emph{quasi-experiment} or
\emph{natural experiment}. This ``as if'' randomness allows for
estimation of causal effects that are of interest for economist using
tools which are very similar to those valid for ideal randomized
controlled experiments. These tools draw heavily on the theory of
multiple regression and also on IV regression (see Chapter \ref{ivr}).
We will review the core aspects of these methods and demonstrate how to
apply them in R using the STAR data set.\footnote{See the
  \href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/10766}{description}

\section{Potential Outcomes, Causal Effects and Idealized
Experiments}\label{potential-outcomes-causal-effects-and-idealized-experiments}

In the following we will briefly recap the idea of the average causal
effect and how it can be estimated using the \emph{differences
estimator}. We advise you to work through Chapter 13.1 of the book for a
better understanding.

\subsubsection*{Potential Outcomes and the average causal
Effect}\label{potential-outcomes-and-the-average-causal-effect}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Potential Outcomes and the average
causal Effect}

A \emph{potential outcome} is the outcome for an individual under a
potential treatment. For this individual, we say that the causal effect
of the treatment is the difference between the potential outcome if the
individual receives the treatment and the potential outcome if she does
not. Since this causal effect may be different for different individuals
and it is not possible to measure the causal effect for a single
individual, one is interested in studying the \emph{average causal
effect} of the treatment, hence also called the \emph{average treatment
effect}.

In a ideal randomized controlled experiment the following conditions are
fulfilled:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The subjects are selected at random from the population.
\item
  The subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and control group.
\end{enumerate}

Condition 1 guarantees that the subjects' potential outcomes are drawn
randomly from the same distribution such that the expected value of the
causal effect in the sample is equal to the average causal effect in the
distribution. Condition 2 ensures that the receipt of treatment is
independent from the subjects potential outcomes. If both conditions are
fulfilled, the expected causal effect is the expected outcome in the
treatment group minus the expected outcome in the control group. Using
conditional expectations we have
\[\text{Average causal effect} =  E(Y_i\vert X_i=1) -  E(Y_i\vert X_i=0),\]
where \(X_i\) is a binary treatment indicator.

The average causal effect can be estimated using the \emph{differences
estimator}, which is nothing but the OLS estimator in the simple
regression model

\begin{align}
  Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n, \label{eq:diffest}
\end{align}

where random assignment ensures that \(E(u_i\vert X_i) = 0\).

The OLS estimator in the regression model

\begin{align}
  Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 W_{1i} + \dots + \beta_{1+r} W_{ri} + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n \label{eq:diffestwar}
\end{align}

with additional regressors \(W_1,\dots,W_r\) is called the
\emph{differences estimator with additional regressors}. It is assumed
that conditional mean independence holds, i.e.
\[E(u_i\vert X_i , W_i) = E(u_i\vert W_i) = 0.\] The \emph{differences
estimator with additional regressors} is more efficient than the
\emph{differences estimator} if the additional regressors explain some
of the variation in the \(Y_i\).

\section{Threats to Validity of
Experiments}\label{threats-to-validity-of-experiments}

The concepts of internal and external validity discussed in Key Concept
9.1 are also applicable for studies based on experimental and
quasi-experimental data. Chapter 13.2 of the book provides a sound
explanation of the particular threats to internal and external validity
of experiments including examples. We limit ourselves to a short
repetition of the threats listed there. Consult the book for a more
detailed explanation.

\subsubsection*{Threats to Internal
Validity}\label{threats-to-internal-validity-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Threats to Internal Validity}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Failure to Randomize}

  If the subjects are not randomly assigned to the treatment group, then
  the outcomes will be contaminated with the effect of the subjects'
  individual characteristics or preferences and it is not possible to
  obtain an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. One can test for
  nonrandom assignment using a significance test (\(F\)-Test) on the
  coefficients in the regression model
  \[X_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 W_{1i} + \dots +\beta_2 W_{ri} + u_i \ \ , \ \ i=1,\dots,n.\]
\item
  \textbf{Failure to Follow the Treatment Protocol}

  If subjects do not follow the treatment protocol, i.e.~some subjects
  in the treatment group manage to avoid receiving the treatment and/or
  some subjects in the control group manage to receive the treatment
  (\emph{partial compliance}), there is correlation between \(X_i\) und
  \(u_i\) such that the OLS estimator of the average treatment effect
  will be biased. If there are data on \emph{both} treatment actually
  recieved (\(X_i\)) and initial random assignment (\(Z_i\)), IV
  regression of the models \eqref{eq:diffest} and \eqref{eq:diffestwar} is a
  remedy.
\item
  \textbf{Attrition}

  Attrition results in a nonrandomly selected sample. If subjects
  systematically drop out of the study after beeing assigned to the
  control or the treatment group ( systematic means that the reason of
  the drop out is related to the treatment) there will be correlation
  between \(X_i\) and \(u_i\) and hence bias in the OLS estimator of the
  treatment effect.
\item
  \textbf{Experimental Effects}

  If human subjects in treatment group and/or control group know that
  they are in an experiment, they might adapt their behaviour in a way
  that prevents unbiased estimation of the treatment effect.
\item
  \textbf{Small Sample Sizes}

  As we know from the theory of linear regression, small sample sizes
  lead to imprecise estimation of the coefficients in regression models
  and thus imply imprecise estimation of the causal effect. Furthermore,
  confidence intervals and hypothesis test may produce wrong inference
  when the sample size is small.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Threats to External
Validity}\label{threats-to-external-validity-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Threats to External Validity}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Nonrepresentative Sample}

  If the population studied and the population of interest are not
  sufficiently similar, there is no justification in generalizing the
  results.
\item
  \textbf{Nonrepresentative Program or Policy}

  If the program or policy for the population studied differs
  considerably from the program (to be) applied to population(s) of
  interest, the results cannot be generalized. For example, a
  small-scale programm with low funding might have different effects
  than a widely available scaled-up programm that is actually
  implemented. There are other factors like duration and the extend of
  monitoring that should be considered here.
\item
  \textbf{General Equilibrium Effects}

  If market and/or environmental conditions cannot be kept constant when
  an internally valid program is implemented broadly, the external
  validity may be doubted.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Estimates of the Effect of Class Size
Reductions}\label{experimental-estimates-of-the-effect-of-class-size-reductions}

\subsection*{Experimental Design and the Data
Set}\label{experimental-design-and-the-data-set}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Experimental Design and the Data Set}

The Project \emph{Sudent-Teacher Achievement Ratio} (STAR) was a large
randomized controlled experiment with the aim of asserting whether a
class size reduction is effective in improving education. It has been
conducted in 80 Tennessee elementary schools over a period of four years
during the 1980s by the state Department of Education.

In the first year, about 6400 students were randomly assigned into one
of three interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher),
regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide
class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide). Classroom
teachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach.
The interventions were initiated as the students entered school in
kindergarten and continued through third grade. Control and treatment
groups across grades are summarized in Table \ref{tab:starstructure}.

Each year, the students learning progress was assessed using the sum of
the points scored on the math and reading parts of a standardized test
(the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Achievement_Test_Series}{Stanford
Achievement Test}).

The STAR data set is part of the package \texttt{AER}.

Using \texttt{head(STAR)} we find that there is a variety of factor
variables that describe student and teacher characteristics as well as
various school indicators, all of which separately recorded for the four
different grades. The data is in \emph{wide format}, that is each
variable has its own column and for each student, the rows contain
observations on these variables. Using \texttt{dim(STAR)} we find that
there are a total of 11598 observations on 47 variables.

Notice that a majority of the variable names contain a suffix
(\texttt{k}, \texttt{1}, \texttt{2} or \texttt{3}) stating the grade
which the respective variable is referring to. This facilitates
regression analysis because it allows to adjust the \texttt{formula}
argument in \texttt{lm()} for each grade by simply changing the
variables' suffixes accordingly.

Inspecting the outcome produced by \texttt{head()} we see that some
values recorded are \texttt{NA} and \texttt{<NA>}, i.e.~there is no data
on this variable for the student under consideration. This lies in the
nature of the data: for example, take the first observation
\texttt{STAR{[}1,{]}}. We find that the student entered the experiment
in third grade in a regular class, which is why the class size is
recorded in \texttt{star3} and the other class type indicator variables
are \texttt{<NA>}. For the same reason there are no recordings of her
math and reading score but for the third grade. It is straightforward to
get only the non-\texttt{NA}/\texttt{<NA>} recordings for her: we simply
drop the \texttt{NA}s using \texttt{is.na()}.

In general it is not necessary to perform such action when doing
regression analysis because \texttt{lm()} excludes incomplete cases,
i.e.~rows with missing data, by default. You should be aware that
missing data may imply a small sample size and thus may lead to
imprecise estimation and wrong inference which is, however, not an issue
for the study at hand since, as we will see below, sample sizes lie
beyond 5000 observations for each regression conducted.

\subsection*{Analysis of the STAR Data}\label{analysis-of-the-star-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Analysis of the STAR Data}

As can be seen from Table \ref{tab:starstructure} there are two
treatment groups in each grade, small classes with only 13 to 17
students and regular classes with 22 to 25 students and a teaching aide.
Thus, two binary variables, each being an indicator for the respective
treatment group, are introduced for the differences estimator to capture
the treatment effect for each treatment group separately. This yields
the population regression model

\begin{align}
  Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 SmallClass_i + \beta_2 RegAide_i + u_i, \label{eq:starpopreg}
\end{align}

with test score \(Y_i\), the small class indicator \(SmallClass_i\) and
\(RegAide_i\), the indicator for a regular class with aide.

We can easily reproduce the results presented in Table 13.1 of the book
by performing the regression \eqref{eq:starpopreg} for each grade
separately. Note that for each student, the dependent variable is simply
the sum of the points scored in the math and reading parts of the test
which is why we make use of the function \texttt{I()}.

The estimates presented in Table \ref{tab:psde} suggest that the class
size reduction does improve performance of the students. Except for
grade 1, the estimates of the coefficient on \(SmallClass\) are roughly
of the same magnitude (the estimates lie between 13.90 and 19.39 points)
and they are statistically significant at the level of \(1\%\).
Furthermore we see that adding a teaching aide to a regular class has
little, possibly zero, effect on the performance of the students.

Following the book, we continue by augmenting the regression model
\eqref{eq:starpopreg} by different sets of additional regressors for two
reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If the additional regressors explain some of the observed variation in
  the dependent variable, we obtain more efficient estimates of the
  coefficients of interest.
\item
  If the treatment is not received at random due to failures to follows
  the treatment protocol (see Chapter 13.3 of the book), the estimates
  obtained using the model specification \eqref{eq:starpopreg} may be
  biased. Adding additional regressors may solve this problem.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, we consider the following student and teacher
characteristics

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(experience\) --- Teacher's years of experience
\item
  \(boy\) --- Student is a boy (dummy)
\item
  \(lunch\) --- Free lunch eligibility (dummy)
\item
  \(black\) --- Student is African-American (dummy)
\item
  \(race\) --- Student's race is other than black or white (dummy)
\item
  \(\text{schoolid}\) --- School indicator variables
\end{itemize}

in the four population regression specifications

\begin{align}
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 SmallClass_i + \beta_2 RegAide_i + u_i, \label{eq:augstarpopreg1} \\
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 SmallClass_i + \beta_2 RegAide_i + \beta_3 experience_i + u_i, \label{eq:augstarpopreg2} \\
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 SmallClass_i + \beta_2 RegAide_i + \beta_3 experience_i + \text{school indicators} + u_i, \label{eq:augstarpopreg3}
\end{align}

and

\begin{align}
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 SmallClass_i + \beta_2 RegAide_i + \beta_3 experience_i + \beta_4 boy + \beta_5 lunch \\ 
+& \beta_6 black + \beta_7 race + \text{schoolid} + u_i. \label{eq:augstarpopreg4}
\end{align}

Beforehand to estimation, we perform some subsetting and some data
wrangling. We do this using functions from the packages \texttt{dplyr}
and \texttt{tidyr} which are both part of \texttt{tidyverse}, a
collection of \texttt{R} packages designed for data science and handling
big data sets.\footnote{See the
  \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{official site} for more on
  \texttt{tidyverse} packages.} The functions \texttt{\%>\%},
\texttt{transmute()} and \texttt{mutate()} are sufficient for us here:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{\%>\%} allows to chain function calls together.
\item
  \texttt{transmute()} allows to subset the data set by naming the
  variables to be kept
\item
  \texttt{mutate()} is convenient for adding new variables based on
  existing ones while preserving the latter.
\end{itemize}

From looking at the regression models \eqref{eq:augstarpopreg1} to
\eqref{eq:augstarpopreg4} we find that variables that are needed to
perform the analysis are \texttt{gender}, \texttt{ethnicity},
\texttt{stark}, \texttt{readk}, \texttt{mathk}, \texttt{lunchk},
\texttt{experiencek} and \texttt{schoolidk}. After dropping the
remaining variables using \texttt{transmute()}, we use \texttt{mutate()}
to add three additional binary variables which are derivatives of
existing ones: \texttt{black}, \texttt{race} and \texttt{boy}. They are
generated using logical statements within the function
\texttt{ifelse()}.

While the results in column (1) of table Table \ref{tab:psdewarfk} are
just a repetition of the outcomes obtained for \eqref{eq:starpopreg}
before, columns (2) to (4) reveal that adding student characteristics
and school fixed effects does not lead to significantly different
estimates of the treatment effects. This result makes it more plausible
that the estimates of the effects obtained using model
\eqref{eq:starpopreg} do not suffer from failure of random assignment.
Note that there is some decrease in the standard errors and some
increase in \(\overline{R}^2\), implying that the estimates are more
precise.

Because teachers were randomly assigned to classes, inclusion of school
fixed effect allows us to estimate the causal effect of a teacher's
experience on test scores of students in kindergarten. For regression
(3) we find that the average effect of 10 years experience on test
scores is predicted to be \(10*0.74=7.4\) points. It is important to be
aware of the fact that the other estimates on student characteristics
used in regression (4) \emph{do not} have causal interpretation due to
nonrandom assignment.\footnote{See Chapter 13.3 of the book for a
  detailed discussion.}

To answer the question whether the estimated effects presented in Table
\ref{tab:psdewarfk} are large or small in a practical sense, we
translate the predicted changes in test scores to units of standard
deviation in order to allow for a comparison (see Section \ref{etsacs}
for a similar argument).

On the one hand, we find that the estimated effect of a small classes is
largest for grade 1. As pointed out in the book, this is probably
because students in the control group for grade 1 did poorly on the test
for some unknown reason or simply due to random variation. On the other
hand, the difference between the estimated effect of being in a small
class and being in a regular classes with an aide is roughly 0.2
standard deviations for all grades. This leads to the conclusion that
the effect of being in a regular sized class with an aide is zero and
the effect of being in a small class is roughly the same for all grades.

The remainder of Chapter 13.3 in the book discusses to what extent these
experimental estimates are comparable with observational estimates
obtained using data on school districts in California and Massachusetts
in Chapter \ref{asbomr}. It turns out that the estimates are indeed very
similar. Please refer to the aforementioned section in the book for a
more lengthy discussion.

\section{Quasi Experiments}\label{quasi-experiments}

In quasi-experiments, ``as if'' randomness is exploited to use methods
similar to those that have been discussed in the previous chapter. There
are two types of quasi-experiments:\footnote{See Chapter 13.4 of the
  book for some example studies that are based on quasi-experiments.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Random variations in individual circumstances allow to view the
  treatment ``as if'' it was randomly determined.
\item
  The treatment is only partially determined by ``as if'' random
  variation.
\end{enumerate}

The former allows to estimate the effect using either model
\eqref{eq:diffestwar}, i.e.~the \emph{difference estimator with additional
regressors}, or, if there is doubt that the ``as if'' randomness does
not entirely ensure that there are no systematic differences between
control and treatment group, using the \emph{differences-in-differences}
(DID) estimator. In the latter case, an IV approach for estimation of a
model like \eqref{eq:diffestwar} which uses the source of ``as if''
randomness in treatment assignment as the instrument may be applied.

Some more advanced techniques that are helpful in settings where the
treatment assignment is (partially) determined by a threshold in a
so-called running variable are \emph{sharp regression discontinuity
design} (RDD) and \emph{fuzzy regression discontinuity design} (FRDD).

We will briefly review these techniques and, since the book does not
provide any empirical examples in this section, we will use our own
simulated data in a minimal example to discuss how DID, RDD and FRDD can
be applied in \texttt{R}.

\subsection*{The Differences-in-Differences
Estimator}\label{the-differences-in-differences-estimator}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Differences-in-Differences
Estimator}

In quasi-experiments it is often the case that the source of ``as if''
randomness in treatment assignment cannot entirely prevent systematic
differences between control and treatment group. This problem was
encountered by \citet{card1994} who use geography as the ``as if''
random treatment assignment to study the effect on employment of workers
in the fast-food restaurants caused by an increase in the state minimum
wage in New Jersey in the year of 1992. Their idea was to use the fact
that the increase in minimum wage applied to employees in New Jersey
(treatment group) but not to those living in the neighboring
Pennsylvania (control group).

It is quite conceivable that such a wage hike is not correlated with
other determinants of employment. However, there still might be some
state-specific differences and thus differences between control and
treatment group. This would render the \emph{differences estimator}
biased and inconsistent. \citet{card1994} solved this by using a DID
estimator: they collected data in February 1992 (before the treatment)
and November 1992 (after the treatment) for the same restaurants and
estimated the effect of the wage hike by analyzing differences in the
differences in employment for New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and
after the increase.\footnote{See also the box \emph{What is the Effect
  on Employment of the Minimum Wage?} in Chapter 13.4 of the book.} The
DID estimator is

\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_1^{\text{diffs-in-diffs}} =& \, (\overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,after}} - \overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,before}}) - (\overline{Y}^{\text{control,after}} - \overline{Y}^{\text{control,before}}) \\
  =& \Delta \overline{Y}^{\text{treatment}} - \Delta \overline{Y}^{\text{control}} \label{eq:DID}
\end{align}

with

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,before}}\) - the sample average in the
  treatment group before the treatment
\item
  \(\overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,after}}\) - the sample average in the
  treatment group after the treatment
\item
  \(\overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,before}}\) - the sample average in the
  control group before the treatment
\item
  \(\overline{Y}^{\text{treatment,after}}\) - the sample average in the
  control group after the treatment.
\end{itemize}

We now use \texttt{R} to reproduce Figure 13.1 of the book.

The DID estimator \eqref{eq:DID} can also be written in regression
notation: \(\widehat{\beta}_1^{\text{DID}}\) is the OLS estimator of
\(\beta_1\) in the model

\begin{align}
  \Delta Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i, \label{eq:did}
\end{align}

where \(\Delta Y_i\) denotes the difference in pre- and post-treatment
outcomes of individual \(i\) and \(X_i\) is the treatment indicator.

Adding additional regressors that measure pre-treatment characteristics
to \eqref{eq:did} we obtain

\begin{align}
  \Delta Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 W_{1i} + \dots + \beta_{1+r} W_{ri} + u_i, \label{eq:didwar}
\end{align}

the \emph{difference-in-differences estimator} with additional
regressors. The additional regressors may lead to a more precise
estimate of \(\beta_1\).

We will keep things simple and focus on estimation of the treatment
effect using DID in the simplest case, that is a control and a treatment
group observed for two time periods --- one before and one after the
treatment. In particular, we will see that there are three different
ways to proceed. \pagebreak

We continue by plotting the data. The function \texttt{jitter()} is used
to add some artificial dispersion in the horizontal component of the

used in plots.

Notice that both observations from control and treatment group have a
higher sample mean after the treatment but that the increase is stronger
for the treatment group. Using DID we may estimate how much of that
difference in the difference between groups is due to the treatment.

It is straightforward to compute the DID estimate in the fashion of
\eqref{eq:DID}.

Notice that the estimate is close to \(4\), the value chosen as the
treatment effect \texttt{TEffect} above. Since \eqref{eq:did} is a simple
linear model, we may perform OLS estimation of this regression
specification using \texttt{lm()}.

We find that the estimates coincide. Furthermore, one can show that the
DID estimate obtained by estimating specification \eqref{eq:did} OLS is
the same as the OLS estimate of \(\beta_{TE}\) in

\begin{align}
  Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \beta_2 Period_i + \beta_{TE} (Period_i \times D_i) \label{eq:DIDint}
\end{align}

where \(D_i\) is the binary treatment indicator, \(Period_i\) is a
binary indicator for the after-treatment period and the
\(Period_i \times D_i\) is the interaction of both.

As for \eqref{eq:did}, estimation of \eqref{eq:DIDint} using \texttt{R} is
straightforward. See Chapter \ref{nrf} for a discussion of interaction
terms in regression models.

As expected, the estimate of the coefficient on the interaction of the
treatment dummy and the time dummy coincide with the estimates obtained
using the approach \eqref{eq:DID} and OLS estimation of \eqref{eq:did}.

\subsection*{Regression Discontinuity
Estimators}\label{regression-discontinuity-estimators}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Regression Discontinuity Estimators}

Consider the model

\begin{align}
  Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 W_i + u_i \label{eq:SRDDsetting}
\end{align}

and let

\begin{align*}
X_i =& 
  \begin{cases}
    1, & W_i \geq c \\
    0, & W_i < c
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

so that the receipt of treatment, \(X_i\), is determined by some
threshold \(c\) of a continuous variable \(W_i\), the so called running
variable. The idea of \emph{regression discontinuity design} is to use
observations with a \(W_i\) close to \(c\) for estimation of
\(\beta_1\). \(\beta_1\) is the average treatment effect for individuals
with \(W_i = c\) which is assumed to be a good approximation to the
treatment effect in the population. \eqref{eq:SRDDsetting} is called a
\emph{sharp regression discontinuity design} because treatment
assignment is deterministic and discontinuous at the cutoff: all
observations with \(W_i < c\) do not receive treatment and all
observations where \(W_i \geq c\) are treated.

The subsequent code chunks show how to estimate a linear SRDD using
\texttt{R} and how to produce plots in the way of Figure 13.2 of the
book.

The argument \texttt{nbins} sets the number of bins the running variable
is divided in for aggregation. The dots represent bin averages of the
outcome variable.

We may use the function \texttt{rdd\_reg\_lm()} to estimate the
treatment effect using model \eqref{eq:SRDDsetting} for the artificial
data generated above. By choosing \texttt{slope = "same"} we restrict

Note that, as above, the dots represent averages of binned observations.

So far we have assumed that crossing of the threshold determines receipt
of treatment so that the jump of the population regression functions at
the threshold can be regarded as the causal effect of the treatment.

When crossing of the threshold \(c\) is not the only cause for receipt
of the treatment and instead other, treatment is not a deterministic
function of \(W_i\). Instead, it is useful to think of the \(c\) as a
threshold where the \emph{probability} of receiving the treatment jumps.

This jump may be due to unobservable variables that have impact on the
probability of being treated. Thus, \(X_i\) in \eqref{eq:SRDDsetting} will
be correlated with the error \(u_i\) and it becomes more difficult to
consistently estimate the treatment effect. In this setting, using a
\emph{fuzzy regression discontinuity design} which is based an IV
approach may be a remedy: take the binary variable \(Z_i\) as an
indicator for crossing of the threshold,

\begin{align*}
  Z_i = \begin{cases}
    1, & W_i \geq c \\
    0, & W_i < c,
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

and assume that \(Z_i\) relates to \(Y_i\) only through the treatment
indicator \(X_i\). Then \(Z_i\) and \(u_i\) are uncorrelated but \(Z_i\)
influences receipt of treatment so it is correlated with \(X_i\). Thus,
\(Z_i\) is a valid instrument for \(X_i\) and \eqref{eq:SRDDsetting} can
be estimated using TSLS.

The following code chunk generates sample data where observations with a
value of the running variable \(W_i\) below the cutoff \(c=0\) do not
receive treatment and observations with \(W_i \geq 0\) do receive
treatment with a probability of \(80\%\) so that treatment status is
only partially determined by the running variable and the cutoff.
Treatment leads to an increase in \(Y\) by \(2\) units. Observations
with \(W_i \geq 0\) that do not receive treatment are called
\emph{no-shows}: think of an individual that was assigned to receive the
treatment but somehow manages to avoid it.

Obviously, receipt of treatment is no longer a deterministic function of
the running variable \(W\). Some observations with \(W\geq0\) \emph{did
not} receive the treatment. We may estimate a FRDD by additionally
setting \texttt{treatProb} as the assignment variable \texttt{z} in
\texttt{rdd\_data()}. Then \texttt{rdd\_reg\_lm()} applies the following
TSLS procedure: treatment is predicted using \(W_i\) and the cutoff
dummy \(Z_i\), the instrumental variable, in the first stage regression.
The fitted values from the first stage regression are used to obtain an
unbiased estimate of the treatment effect using the second stage where
the outcome \(Y\) is regressed on the fitted values and the running
variable \(W\).

The estimate obtained using a SRDD shows a substantial downward bias. In
fact this procedure is inconsistent for the true causal effect so
enlarging the sample does not alleviate the bias.

Hereinafter the book continues with a discussion of potential problems
with quasi-experiments. As for all empirical studies, these potential
problems are related to internal and external validity. This part is
followed by a technical discussion of treatment effect estimation when
the causal effect of treatment is heterogeneous in the population. We
encourage you to work on these sections on your own.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-5}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

In this chapter we have introduced the concept of causal effect in
randomized controlled experiments and quasi-experiments where variations
in circumstances or accidents of nature are treated as sources of ``as
if'' random assignment to treatment. We have also discussed methods that
allow for unbiased and consistent estimation of these effects in both
settings. This included the \emph{differences estimator}, the
\emph{differences-in-differences estimator} as well as \emph{sharp} and
\emph{fuzzy regression discontinuity design} estimators. It was shown
how to apply these estimation techniques in \texttt{R}.

In an empirical application we have shown how to replicate the results
of the analysis of the STAR data presented in Chapter 13.3 of the book
using \texttt{R}. This study uses a randomized controlled experiment to
assess whether smaller classes improve students' performance on
standardized tests. We have stressed that, being related to a randomized
controlled experiment, the data produced by this study are fundamentally
different to those used in the cross-section studies Chapters
\ref{lrwor} to \ref{nrf} and therefore we have motivated usage of a
\emph{differences estimator}.

Chapter \ref{attdfc} demonstrated how estimates of treatment effects can
be obtained when the design of the study is a quasi-experiment that
allows for \emph{differences-in-differences} or \emph{regression
discontinuity design} estimators. In particular, we have introduced core
functions of the package \texttt{rddtools} that are convenient for
estimation as well as graphical analysis of the research design before
and after estimating a regression discontinuity design.

\chapter{Introduction to Time Series Regression and
Forecasting}\label{ittsraf}

Time series data is data that is collected for a single entity over
time. This is fundamentally different from cross-section data which is
data on multiple entities at the same point in time. Time series data
allows estimation of the effect on \(Y\) of a change in \(X\) \emph{over
time}. This is what econometricians call a \emph{dynamic causal effect}.
Let us go back to the application to cigarette consumption of Chapter
\ref{ivr} where we were interested in estimating the effect on cigarette
demand of a price increase caused by a raise of the general sales tax.
One might use time series data to assess the causal effect of a tax
increase on smoking both initially and in subsequent periods.

Another application of time series data is forecasting. For example,
weather services use time series data to predict tomorrow's average
temperature by inter alia using today's average temperature and average
temperatures of the past. To motivate an economic example, central banks
are interested in forecasting next month's unemployment rates.

The remainder of the book deals with the econometric techniques for the
analysis of time series data and application of the latter to problems
of forecasting and estimation of dynamic causal effects. This section
covers the basic concepts presented in Chapter 14 of the book, explains
how to visualize time series data and demonstrates how to estimate
simple autoregressive models, where the regressors are past values of
the dependent variable or other variables. In this context we will also
discuss the concept of stationarity, an important property which has
far-reaching consequences since it determines whether the past of a
series has any power in explaining the series' future.

Most empirical applications in this chapter are concerned with
forecasting and use data on U.S. macroeconomic indicators or financial
time series like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the unemployment rate or
excess stock returns.

\section{Using Regression Models for
Forecasting}\label{using-regression-models-for-forecasting}

What is the difference between estimating models for assessment of
causal effects and forecasting? Consider again the simple example of
estimating the casual effect of the student-teacher ratio on test scores
introduced in Chapter \ref{lrwor}.

## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)          STR  
##      698.93        -2.28
\end{verbatim}

As has been stressed in Chapter \ref{rmwmr}, the estimate of the
coefficient on the student-teacher ratio does not have causal
interpretation due to omitted variable bias. However, in terms deciding
which school to send her child to, it might nevertheless be appealing
for a parent to use \texttt{mod} for forecasting test scores in
schooling districts where no public data about on scores are available.

As an example, assume that the average class in a district has \(25\)
students. There is no such thing as a perfect forecast but the following
one-liner might be helpful for the parent to decide.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##        1 
## 641.9377
\end{verbatim}

In a time series context, the parent could use data on present and past
years test scores to forecast next years test scores --- a typical
application for an autoregressive model.

\section{Time Series Data and Serial Correlation}\label{tsdasc}

GDP measures the productivity of an economy. It is commonly defined as
the value of goods and services produced over a given time period. The
data set \texttt{us\_macro\_quarterly.xlsx} is provided by the authors
and can be downloaded
\href{http://wps.aw.com/aw_stock_ie_3/178/45691/11696965.cw/index.html}{here}.
It provides quarterly data on U.S. real (i.e.~inflation adjusted) GDP
from years 1947 to 2004.

As before, a good point to start with in pre-estimation is plotting the
data. The package \texttt{quantmod} provides some very convenient
functions for plotting and computing with time series data. We also load
the package \texttt{readxl} to read the data into \texttt{R}.

When dealing with time series data in \texttt{R} it is preferable to
work with time-series objects that keep track of the frequency of the
data and are extensible. In what follows we will use objects of the
class \texttt{xts}, see \texttt{?xts}. Since the data in
\texttt{USMacroSWQ} are in quarterly frequency we convert the first
column to \texttt{yearqtr} format before generating the \texttt{xts}
object \texttt{GDP}.

\subsection*{Notation, Lags, Differences, Logarithms and Growth
Rates}\label{notation-lags-differences-logarithms-and-growth-rates}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Notation, Lags, Differences,
Logarithms and Growth Rates}

If observations of a variable \(Y\) are recorded over time, we denote
\(Y_t\) the value observed at time \(t\). The period between two
sequential observations \(Y_t\) and \(Y_{t-1}\) is a unit of time:
hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, years and so on. Key Concept 14.1
introduces the essential terminology and notation for time series data
we will use in the subsequent sections.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Lags, First Differences, Logarithms and Growth Rates]{14.1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Previous values of a time series are called \textit{lags}. The first lag of $Y_t$ is $Y_{t-1}$. The $j^{th}$ lag of $Y_t$ is $Y_{t-j}$. In \texttt{R}, lags of univariate or multivariate time series objects are conveniently computed by \texttt{lag()}, see \texttt{?lag}.
\item Sometimes we need to work with a differenced series. The first difference of a series is $\Delta Y_{t} = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$, the difference between periods $t$ and $t-1$. If \texttt{Y} is a time series, the series of first differences is computed as \texttt{Y-lag(Y)}.
\item It may be convenient to work with the first difference in logarithms of a series. We denote this by $\Delta \log(Y_t) = \log(Y_t) - \log(Y_{t-1})$. For a time series \texttt{Y}, this is obtained using \texttt{log(Y/lag(Y))}. 
\item $100 \Delta \log (Y_t)$ is an approximation for the percentage change between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-1}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

The definitions made in Key Concept 14.1 are useful because of two
properties that are common to many economic time series:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Exponential growth: some economic series grow approximately
  exponentially such that taking the logarithm of these series makes
  them approximately linear.
\item
  The standard deviation of many economic time series is approximately
  proportional to their level. Therefore, the standard deviation of the
  logarithm of such a series is approximately constant.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, it is common to report rates of growth in macroeconomic
series which is why \(\log\)-differences are often used.

Table 14.1 of the book presents the quarterly U.S. GDP time series, its
logarithm, the annualized growth rate and the first lag of the
annualized growth rate series for the period 2012:Q1 - 2013:Q1. The
following simple function can be used to compute these quantities for a
quarterly time series \texttt{series}.

Notice that the annual growth rate is computed using the approximation
\[ Annual Growth Y_t = 400 \cdot \left[\log(Y_t) - \log(Y_{t-1})\right] \]

\subsubsection*{Autocorrelation}\label{autocorrelation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Autocorrelation}

Observations of a time series are typically correlated. This type of
correlation is called \emph{autocorrelation} or \emph{serial
correlation}. Key Concept 14.2 summarizes the concepts of population
autocovariance and population autocorrelation and shows how to compute
their sample equivalents.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Autocorrelation and Autocovariance]{14.2}
The covariance between $Y_t$ and its $j^{th}$ lag, $Y_{t-j}$, is called the $j^{th}$ \textit{autocovariance} of the series $Y_t$. The $j^{th}$ \textit{autocorrelation coefficient}, also called the \textit{serial correlation coefficient}, measures the correlation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-j}$. We thus have
\begin{align*}
  j^{th} \text{autocovariance} =& \, Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-j}), \\
  j^{th} \text{autocorrelation} = \rho_j =& \, \rho_{Y_t,Y_{t-j}} = \frac{Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-j)}}{\sqrt{Var(Y_t)Var{Y_{t-j}}}}.
\end{align*}

Population autocovariance and population autocorrelation can be estimated by $\widehat{Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-j})}$, the sample autocovariance, and $\widehat{\rho}_j$, the sample autocorrelation:
\begin{align*}
  \widehat{Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-j})} =& \, \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=j+1}^T (Y_t - \overline{Y}_{j+1:T})(Y_{t-j} - \overline{Y}_{1:T-j}), \\
  \widehat{\rho}_j =& \, \frac{\widehat{Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-j})}}{\widehat{Var(Y_t)}}.
\end{align*}

In \texttt{R} the function \texttt{acf()} from the package \texttt{stats} computes the sample autocovariance or the sample autocorrelation function.
\end{keyconcepts}

Using \texttt{acf()} it is straightforward to compute the first four
sample autocorrelations of the series \texttt{GDPGrowth}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

This is evidence that there is mild positive autocorrelation in the
growth of GDP: if GDP grows faster than average in one period, there is
a tendency that it grows faster than average in the following periods.

Note that the series show quite different characteristics. The
unemployment rate increases during recessions and declines in times of
economic recoveries and growth. The Dollar/Pound exchange rates shows a
deterministic pattern until the end of the Bretton Woods system. Japans
industrial production exhibits an upward trend and decreasing growth.
Daily changes in the New York Stock Exchange composite index seem to be

The blue dashed lines represent an approximate \(95\%\) confidence
interval if there was no serial correlation. If a sample autocorrelation
lies beyond these bands, it is statistically different from zero. For
most lags we see that the sample autocorrelation does not exceed the
confidence bands and there are only a few cases that lie marginally
beyond the limits.

Furthermore, note that NYSWSW series shows a pattern which
econometricians call \emph{volatility clustering}: there are periods of
high and periods of low variance. This is common for many financial time
series.

\section{Autoregressions}\label{autoregressions}

Growth forecasts are important for many economic entities. For example,
the production sector relies on forecasts of GDP growth published by the
central bank when deciding on future budgets and production plans.
Autoregressive models are heavily used in economic forecasting. An
autoregressive model relates a time series variable to its past values.
This chapter discusses the basic ideas of autoregressions models, shows
how they are estimated and discusses an application to forecasting of
GDP growth using \texttt{R}.

\subsubsection*{The First-Order Autoregressive
Model}\label{the-first-order-autoregressive-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{The First-Order Autoregressive
Model}

It is intuitive that the immediate past of a time series should have
power to predict its near future. The simplest autoregressive model uses
only the most recent outcome of the time series observed to predict
future values. Such a model is called a first-order autoregressive model
which is often abbreviated AR(1), where the 1 indicates that the order
of autoregression is one.

\begin{align*}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align*}

is the AR(1) population model of a time series \(Y_t\).

For the GDP growth series, an autoregressive model of order one uses
only the information on GDP growth observed in the last quarter to
predict a future growth rate. The first-order autoregression model of
the GDP growth rate can be estimated by computing OLS estimates in the
regression of \(GDPGR_t\) on \(GDPGR_{t-1}\),

\begin{align}
  \widehat{GDPGR}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 GDPGR_{t-1} + u_t. \label{eq:GDPGRAR1}
\end{align}

Following the book we use data from 1962 to 2012 to estimate
\eqref{eq:GDPGRAR1}. This is easily done with the function
\texttt{ar.ols()} from package \texttt{stats}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

We can check that the computations done by \texttt{ar.ols()} are the
same as done by \texttt{lm()}.

As usual, we may use \texttt{coeftest()} to obtain a robust summary on
the estimated regression coefficients.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
\end{verbatim}

Thus the estimated model is

\begin{align}
  \widehat{GDPGR}_t = \underset{(0.351)}{1.995} + \underset{(0.076)}{0.338} GDPGR_{t-1} \label{eq:gdpgrar1}.
\end{align}

Notice that we omit the first observation for \(GDPGR_{1962 \ Q1}\) from
the vector of the dependent variable since
\(GDPGR_{1962 \ Q1 - 1} = GDPGR_{1961 \ Q4}\), is not included in the
sample. Similarly, the last observation, \(GDPGR_{2012 \ Q4}\), is
excluded from the predictor vector since the data set does not include
\(GDPGR_{2012 \ Q4 + 1} = GDPGR_{2013 \ Q1}\). Put differently, when
estimating the model, one observation is lost because of the time series
structure of the data.

\subsubsection*{Forecasts and Forecast
Errors}\label{forecasts-and-forecast-errors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Forecasts and Forecast Errors}

Suppose a random variable \(Y_t\) follows an AR(1) model with an
intercept and that you have an OLS estimate of the model on the basis of
observations for \(T\) periods. Then you may use the AR(1) model to
obtain \(Y_{T+1\vert T}\), a forecast for \(Y_{T+1}\) using data up to
period \(T\) where

\begin{align*}
  \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 Y_T.
\end{align*}

The forecast error is

\begin{align*}
  \text{Forecast error} = Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Forecasts and Predicted
Values}\label{forecasts-and-predicted-values}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Forecasts and Predicted Values}

Note that \emph{forecasted values} of \(Y_t\) are \emph{not} what we
refer to as \emph{OLS predicted values} of \(Y_t\). Also, the forecast
error is \emph{not} an OLS residual. Forecasts and forecast errors are
obtained using \emph{out-of-sample} values while predicted values and
residuals are computed for \emph{in-sample} values that were actually
observed and used in estimation of the model.

The root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) measures the typical size
of the forecast error and is defined as

\begin{align*}
  RMSFE = \sqrt{E\left[\left(Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T}\right)^2\right]}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Application to GDP
Growth}\label{application-to-gdp-growth}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Application to GDP Growth}

Using \eqref{eq:gdpgrar1}, the estimated AR(1) model of GDP growth, we may
perform the forecast for GDP growth in 2013:Q1 (remember that the model
was estimated using data for periods 1962:Q1 - 2012:Q4 so 2013:Q1 is an
out of sample period). This is done by plugging
\(GDPGR_{2012:Q4} \approx 0.15\) in \eqref{eq:gdpgrar1},

\begin{align*}
  \widehat{GDPGR}_{2013:Q1} = 1.995 + 0.348 \cdot 0.15 = 2.047.
\end{align*}

The function \texttt{forecast()} from the \texttt{forecast} package has

Using \texttt{forecast()} we obtain the same point forecast of about
2.0, along with \(80\%\) and \(95\%\) forecast intervals. We conclude
that our AR(1) model forecasts GDP growth to be \(2\%\) in 2013:Q1.

How accurate is this forecast? First, notice that the forecast error is
pretty big: \(GDPGR_{2013:Q1} \approx 1.1\%\) while our forecast is
\(2\%\). Second, by calling \texttt{summary()} on \texttt{armod} we find
that the model explains only little of the variation in the growth rate
of GDP and the \(SER\) is about \(3.16\). Leaving aside forecast
uncertainty due to estimation of the model coefficients \(\beta_0\) and
\(\beta_1\), the \(RMSFE\) must be at least \(3.16\%\) which is pretty
inaccurate.

\subsection*{Autoregressive Models of Order
p}\label{autoregressive-models-of-order-p}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Autoregressive Models of Order p}

For forecasting GPD growth in period \(t\), the AR(\(1\)) model
\eqref{eq:gdpgrar1} disregards any information in the past of the series
that is more distant than one period. An AR(\(p\)) model incorporates
the information of \(p\) lags of the series. The idea is explained in
Key Concept 14.3.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Autoregressions]{14.3}
An AR($p$) model assumes that a time series $Y_t$ can be modeled by a linear function of the first $p$ of its lagged values.
\begin{align*}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \beta_p Y_{t-p} + u_t
\end{align*}
is an autoregressive model of order $p$ where $E(u_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \dots,Y_{t-p})=0$.
\end{keyconcepts}

Following the book, we estimate an AR(\(2\)) model of the GDP growth
series from 1962:Q1 to 2012:Q4.

The estimation yields

\end{align}

We see that the coefficient on the second lag is significantly different
from zero. Note that the fit improves slightly: \(\overline{R^2}\) grows
from \(0.11\) for the AR(\(1\)) model to about \(0.14\) and the \(SER\)
reduces to \(3.13\).

\section{Can You Beat the Market? (Part I)}\label{cybtmpi}

The theory of efficient capital markets states that stock prices embody
all currently available information. If this hypothesis holds, it should
not be possible to estimate a useful model for forecasting future stock
returns using publicly available information on past returns (this is
also referred to as the weak-form efficiency hypothesis): if it was
possible to forecast the market, traders would be able to make
arbitrage, e.g.~by relying on an AR(\(2\)) model, they would use
information that is not already priced-in which would be not consistent
with the theory.

This idea is presented in the Box \emph{Can You Beat the Market? (Part
I)} on p.~582 of the book. This section reproduces the estimation
results.

We start by importing monthly data from 1931:1 to 2002:12 on excess
returns of a broad-based index of stock prices, the CRSP value-weighted
index. The data are provided by the authors of the book as an excel
sheet which can be downloaded

\end{Highlighting}

We continue by converting the data to an object of class \texttt{ts}.

        \DataTypeTok{frequency =} \DecValTok{12}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Next, we estimate AR(\(1\)), AR(\(2\)) and AR(\(4\)) models of excess
returns for the time period 1960:1 to 2002:12.

The results presented above are consistent with the hypothesis of
efficient financial markets: there are no statistically significant
coefficients in any of the estimated models and the hypotheses that the
respective set of lags has no power in explaining today's returns cannot
be rejected. Notice also that \(\overline{R^2}\) is almost zero in all
models and even negative for the AR(\(4\)) model. This suggests that
none of the models are useful for forecasting stock returns.

\section{Additional Predictors and The ADL Model}\label{apatadlm}

Instead of only using the dependent variable's lags as predictors, an
autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model also uses lags of other
variables for forecasting. The general ADL model is summarized in Key
Concept 14.4

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model]{14.4}
An ADL($p$,$q$) model assumes that a time series $Y_t$ can be represented by a linear function of $p$ of its lagged values and $q$ lags of $X_t$, another time series $X_t$.
\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \beta_p Y_{t-p} \\ 
      +& \, \delta_1 X_{t-1} + \delta_2 X_{t-2} + \dots + \delta_q X_{t-q} X_{t-q} + u_t.
\end{align*}
is an \textit{autoregressive distributed lag model} with $p$ lags of $Y_t$ and $q$ lags of $X_t$ where $$E(u_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \dots, X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, \dots)=0.$$
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsubsection*{Forecasting GDP Growth Using the Term
Spread}\label{forecasting-gdp-growth-using-the-term-spread}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Forecasting GDP Growth Using the
Term Spread}

Interests on long-term and short term treasury bonds are closely linked
to the macroeconomic development. While interest rates on both types of
bonds have the same long-run tendencies, they behave quite differently
in the short run. The difference in interest rates of two bonds with
distinct maturity is called the \emph{term spread}.

The following code chunks reproduce Figure 14.3 of the book which

Notice that before recessions, the gap between interests on long-term
bonds and short term bills narrows and consequently the term spread
declines drastically towards zero or even falls below zero in times of
economic stress. This information might be used to improve forecasts of
future GDP growth.

We check this by estimating an ADL(\(2\),\(1\)) model and an
ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) model of the GDP growth rate using lags of GDP growth
and lags of the term spread as regressors and use both models for
forecasting the GDP growth in 2013:Q1.

The ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) forecast of GDP growth in 2013:Q1 is \(2.27\%\)
which implies a forecast error of \(1.14\%\).

Do the ADL models \eqref{eq:gdpgradl21} and \eqref{eq:gdpgradl22} improve
upon the simple AR(\(2\)) model \eqref{eq:GDPGRAR2} in terms of
forecasting GPD growth in 2013:Q1? The answer is yes: while \(SER\) and
\(\overline{R}^2\) improve only slightly, an \(F\)-test on the term
spread coefficients in \eqref{eq:gdpgradl22} provides evidence that the
model does better in explaining GPD growth than the AR(\(2\)) model as
the hypothesis that both coefficients are zero cannot be rejected at the
level of \(5\%\).

\subsubsection*{Stationarity}\label{stationarity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Stationarity}

In general, forecasts an be improved by using multiple predictors ---
just as in cross-sectional regression. For time series regressions to
yield reliable models, the assumption of \emph{stationarity} must be
fulfilled. Key Concept 14.5 explains what stationarity is.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Stationarity]{14.5}
A time series $Y_t$ is stationary if its probability distribution is time independent, that is the joint distribution of $Y_{s+1}, Y_{s+2},\dots,Y_{s+T}$ does not change as $s$ is varied, regardless of $T$.\newline

Similarly, two time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are \textit{jointly stationary} if the joint distribution of $(X_{s+1},Y_{s+1}, X_{s+2},Y_{s+2} \dots, X_{s+T}, Y_{s+T})$ does not depend on $s$, regardless of $T$.\newline

In a probabilistic sense, stationarity means that information about how a time series evolves in the future is inherent to its past. If this is not the case, we cannot use the past of a series as a reliable guideline for its future.
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsubsection*{Time Series Regression with Multiple
Predictors}\label{time-series-regression-with-multiple-predictors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Time Series Regression with
Multiple Predictors}

The concept of stationarity is a key assumption in the general time
series regression model with multiple predictors. Key Concept 14.6
elaborates this model and its assumptions.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Time Series Regression with Multiple Predictors]{14.6}
The general time series regression model extends the ADL model such that multiple regressors and their lags are included. It uses $p$ lags of the dependent variable and $q_l$ lags of $l$ additional predictors where $l=1,\dots,k$:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \beta_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \beta_{p} Y_{t-p} \\
      +& \, \delta_{11} X_{1,t-1} + \delta_{12} X_{1,t-2} + \dots + \delta_{1q} X_{1,t-q} \\
      +& \, \dots \\
      +& \, \delta_{k1} X_{k,t-1} + \delta_{k2} X_{k,t-2} + \dots + \delta_{kq} X_{k,t-q} \\
      +& \, u_t 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For estimation we make the following assumptions:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item The error term $u_t$ has conditional mean zero given all regressors and their lags: $$E(u_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \dots, X_{1,t-1}, X_{1,t-2} \dots, X_{k,t-1}, X_{k,t-2}, \dots)$$ This assumption is an extension of the conditional mean zero assumption used for AR and ADL models and guarantees that the general time series regression model stated above gives the best forecast of $Y_t$ given its lags, the additional regressors $X_{1,t},\dots,X_{k,t}$ and their lags.  
\item The i.i.d. assumption for cross-sectional data is not (entirely) meaningful for time series data. We replace it by the following assumption witch consists of two parts:\newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] The $(Y_{t}, X_{1,t}, \dots, X_{k,t})$ have a stationary distribution (the "identically distributed" part of the i.i.d. assumption for cross-setional data). If this does not hold, forecasts may be biased and inference can be strongly misleading.    
  
    \item[(b)] $(Y_{t}, X_{1,t}, \dots, X_{k,t})$ and $(Y_{t-j}, X_{1,t-j}, \dots, X_{k,t-j})$ become independent as $j$ gets large (the "idependently" distributed part of the i.i.d. assumption for cross-sectional data). This assumption is also called \textit{weak dependence}. It ensures that the WLLN and the CLT hold in large samples.
\end{itemize}
    
\item Large outliers are unlikely: $E(X_{1,t}^4), E(X_{2,t}^4), \dots, E(X_{k,t}^4)$ and $E(Y_t^4)$ have nonzero, finite fourth moments.  

\item No perfect multicollinearity.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

Since many economic time series appear to be nonstationary, assumption
two of Key Concept 14.6 is a crucial one in applied macroeconomics and
finance which is why statistical test for stationarity or
nonstationarity have been developed. Chapters \ref{llsuic} and \ref{nit}
are devoted to this topic.

\subsubsection*{Statistical inference and the Granger causality
test}\label{statistical-inference-and-the-granger-causality-test}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Statistical inference and the
Granger causality test}

If a \(X\) is a useful predictor for \(Y\), in a regression of \(Y_t\)
on lags of its own and lags of \(X_t\), not all of the coefficients on
the lags on \(X_t\) are zero. This concept is called \emph{Granger
causality} and is an interesting hypothesis to test. Key Concept 14.7
summarizes the idea.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Granger Causality Tests]{14.7}
The Granger causality test \citep{granger1969} is an $F$ test of the null hypothesis that \textit{all} lags of a variable $X$ included in a time series regression model do not have predictive power for $Y_t$. The Granger causality test does not test whether $X$ actually \textit{causes} $Y$ but whether the included lags are informative in terms of predicting $Y$.
\end{keyconcepts}

Notice that we have already performed a Granger causality test on the
coefficients of term spread in \eqref{eq:gdpgradl22}, the ADL(\(2\),\(2\))
model of GDP growth and concluded that at least one of the first two
lags of term spread has predictive power for GDP growth.

\subsection*{Forecast Uncertainty and Forecast
Intervals}\label{forecast-uncertainty-and-forecast-intervals}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Forecast Uncertainty and Forecast
Intervals}

In general, it is a good practice to report a measure of the uncertainty
inherent to the estimation. Uncertainty is particularly of interest when
forecasting a time series. For example, consider a simple ADL\((1,1)\)
model

\begin{align*}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \delta_1 X_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align*}

where \(u_t\) is a homoskedastic error term. The forecast error is

\begin{align*}
  Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T} = u_{T+1} - \left[(\widehat{\beta}_0 - \beta_0) + (\widehat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1) Y_T + (\widehat{\delta_1} - \delta_1) X_t \right].
\end{align*}

The mean squared forecast error (MSFE) and the RMFSE are

\begin{align*}
  MFSE =& \, E\left[(Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T})^2 \right] \\
       =& \, \sigma_u^2 + Var\left[ (\widehat{\beta}_0 - \beta_0) + (\widehat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1) Y_T + (\widehat{\delta_1} - \delta_1) X_t \right], \\
  RMFSE =& \, \sqrt{\sigma_u^2 + Var\left[ (\widehat{\beta}_0 - \beta_0) + (\widehat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1) Y_T + (\widehat{\delta_1} - \delta_1) X_t \right]}.
\end{align*}

A \(95\%\) forecast interval is an interval that covers the true value
of \(Y_{T+1}\) in \(95\%\) of repeated applications. Note that there is
a major difference in computing a confidence interval and a forecast
interval: when computing a confidence interval of a point estimate we
use large sample approximations that are justified by the CLT and thus
are valid for a large range of error term distributions. For computation
of a forecast interval of \(Y_{T+1}\), however, we must make an
additional assumption about the distribution of \(u_{T+1}\), the error
term in period \(T+1\). Assuming that \(u_{T+1}\) is normally
distributed one can construct a \(95\%\) \emph{forecast interval} for
\(Y_{T+1}\) using \(SE(Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T})\), an
estimate of the RMSFE:

\begin{align*}
  \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T} \pm 1.96 \cdot SE(Y_{T+1} - \widehat{Y}_{T+1\vert T})
\end{align*}

Of course the computation gets more complicated when the error term is
heteroskedastic or if we are interested in computing a forecast interval
for \(T+s, s>1\).

In some applications it is useful to report multiple forecast intervals
for each step in range of subsequent periods, see the Box \emph{The
River of Blood} on p.~592 of the book. Such forecast ranges can be
visualized in a so-called fan chart. We will not replicate the fan chart
presented in Figure 14.2 of book because the underlying model is by far
more complex than the simple AR and ADL models treated here. Instead, in
the example below we use simulated time series data and estimate an
ADL(\(1\),\(1\)) model which is then used for forecasting the subsequent
25 future outcomes of the series. We choose
\texttt{level\ =\ seq(5,99,10)} in the call of \texttt{forecast()} such
that forecast intervals with levels \(5\%, 15\%, \dots, 95\%\) are
computed for each point forecast of the series.

\section{Lag Length Selection Using Information Criteria}\label{llsuic}

The selection of lag lengths in AR and ADL models can be partially
governed by economic theory. However, there are statistical methods that
are helpful to determine how many lags should be included as regressors.
In general, to many lags inflate the standard errors of coefficient
estimates and thus imply an increase in the forecast error while
omitting lags that should be included in the model may result in an
estimation bias.

The order of an AR model can be determined using two approaches:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  ** The F-test approach**

  Estimate an AR(\(p\)) model and test the significance of the largest
  lag(s). If the test rejects, drop the respective lag(s) from the
  model. This approach has the tendency to produce models where the
  order is too large: in a significance test we always face the risk of
  rejecting a true null hypothesis!
\item
  \textbf{Relying on an information criterion}

  To circumvent the issue of producing too large models, one may choose
  the lag order that minimizes one of the following two information
  criteria:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \emph{Bayes information criterion} (BIC):

    \[BIC(p) = \log\left(\frac{SSR(p)}{T}\right) + (p + 1) \frac{\log(T)}{T}\]
  \item
    The \emph{Akaike information criterion} (AIC):

    \[AIC(p) = \log\left(\frac{SSR(p)}{T}\right) + (p + 1) \frac{2}{T}\]
  \end{itemize}

  Both criteria are estimators of the optimal lag length \(p\). The lag
  order \(\widehat{p}\) that minimizes the respective criterion is
  called the \emph{BIC estimate} or the \emph{AIC estimate} of the
  optimal model order. The basic idea of both criteria is that the
  \(SSR\) decreases as additional lags are added to the model such that
  the first addend decreases wheras the second addend increases as the
  lag order grows. One can show that the the \(BIC\) is a consistent
  estimator of the true lag order while the AIC is not which is due to
  the differing factors in the second addend. Nevertheless, both
  estimators are used in practice where the \(AIC\) is sometimes used as
  an alternative when the \(BIC\) yields a model with too few lags.
\end{enumerate}

The function\texttt{dynlm()} does not compute information criteria by
default. We will therefore write a short function that reports the
\(BIC\) (along with the chosen lag order \(p\) and \(R^2\)) for objects
of class \texttt{dynlm}.

Note that increasing the lag order increases \(R^2\) because the \(SSR\)
decreases as additional lags are added to the model but according to the
\(BIC\), we should decide for the AR(\(2\)) model instead of the
AR(\(6\)) model. It helps to decide whether the decrease in \(SSR\) is
enough to justify adding an additional regressor.

If we would have to compare a bigger set of models, a convenient way to
select the model with the lowest \(BIC\) is using the function
\texttt{which.min()}

\end{verbatim}

The \(BIC\) may also be used to select lag lengths in time series
regression models with multiple predictors. In a model with \(K\)
coefficients, including the intercept, we have

\begin{align*}
    BIC(K) = \log\left(\frac{SSR(K)}{T}\right) + K \frac{\log(T)}{T}.
\end{align*}

Notice that choosing the optimal model according to the \(BIC\) can be
computationally demanding because there may be many different
combinations of lag lengths when there are multiple predictors.

To motivate an example, we estimate ADL(\(p\),\(q\)) models of GDP
growth where, as above, the additional variable is the term spread
between short-term and long-term bonds. We impose the restriction that
\(p=q_1=\dots=q_k\) so that only \(p_{max}\) models
(\(p=1,\dots,p_{max}\)) need to be estimated. In the example below we
choose \(p_{max} = 12\).

\section{Nonstationarity I: Trends}\label{nit}

If a series is nonstationary, conventional hypothesis tests, confidence
intervals and forecasts can be strongly misleading. The assumption of
stationarity is violated if a series exhibits trends or breaks and the
resulting complications in an econometric analysis depend on the
specific type of the nonstationarity. This section focuses on time
series that exhibit trends.

A series is said to exhibit a trend if it fluctuates around a persistent
long-term movement. One distinguishes between \emph{deterministic} and
\emph{stochastic} trends.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A trend is \emph{deterministic} if it is a nonrandom function of time.
\item
  A trend is said to be \emph{stochastic} if it is a random function of
  time.
\end{itemize}

A careful look at the figures we have produced in Chapter \ref{tsdasc}
reveals that many economic time series show a trending behavior that is
probably best modeled by stochastic trends. This is why the book focuses
on the treatment of stochastic trends.

\subsubsection*{The Random Walk Model of a
Trend}\label{the-random-walk-model-of-a-trend}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{The Random Walk Model of a Trend}

The simplest way to model a time series \(Y_t\) that has stochastic
trend is the \emph{random walk}

\begin{align}
  Y_t = Y_{t-1} + u_t, \label{eq:randomwalk}
\end{align}

where the \(u_t\) are i.i.d. errors with
\(E(u_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \dots) = 0\). Note that

\begin{align*}
  E(Y_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}\dots) =& \, E(Y_{t-1}\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}\dots) + E(u_t\vert Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}\dots) \\
  =& \, Y_{t-1}
\end{align*}

so the best forecast for \(Y_t\), today's value of \(Y\), is
\(Y_{t-1}\), the observation made yesterday so the difference between
\(Y_t\) and \(Y_{t-1}\) is unpredictable. One can shows that the path
followed by \(Y_t\) consists of random steps \(u_t\), hence it is called
a random walk.

Assume that \(Y_0\), the starting value of the random walk is \(0\).
Another way to write out \eqref{eq:randomwalk} is

\begin{align*}
  Y_0 =& \, 0 \\
  Y_1 =& \, 0 + u_1 \\
  Y_2 =& \, 0 + u_1 + u_2 \\
  \vdots & \, \\
  Y_t =& \, \sum_{i=1}^t u_i.
\end{align*}

Therefore we have

\begin{align*}
  var(Y_t) =& \, Var(u_1 + u_2 + \dots + u_t) \\
           =& \, t \sigma_u^2.
\end{align*}

Thus the variance of a random walk depends on \(t\) which violates the
assumption presented in Key Concept 14.5: a random walk is
nonstationary.

Obviously, \eqref{eq:randomwalk} is a special case of an AR(\(1\)) model
where \(\beta_1 = 1\). One can show that a time series that follows an
AR(\(1\)) model is stationary if \(\lvert\beta_1\rvert < 1\). In a
general AR(\(p\)) model, stationarity is linked to the roots of the
polynomial
\[1-\beta_1 z - \beta_2 z^2 - \beta_3 z^3 - \dots - \beta_p z^p.\] If
all roots are greater than \(1\) in absolute value, the AR(\(p\)) series
is stationary. If at least one root equals \(1\), the AR(\(p\)) is said
to have a \emph{unit root} and thus has a stochastic trend.

It is straightforward to simulate random walks in \texttt{R} using
\texttt{arima.sim()}. The function \texttt{matplot()} is convenient for
simple plots of the columns of a matrix.

a \emph{random walk model with a drift} which allows to model the

positive, the series drifts upwards and it follows a downward trend if
\(\beta_0\) is negative.

\subsubsection*{Problems Caused by Stochastic
Trends}\label{problems-caused-by-stochastic-trends}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problems Caused by Stochastic
Trends}

OLS estimation of the coefficients on regressors that have a stochastic
trend is problematic because the distribution of the estimator and its
\(t\)-statistic is non-normal, even asymptotically. This has various
consequences:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Downward bias of autoregressive coefficients:

  If \(Y_t\) is a random walk, the coefficient \(\beta_1\) can be
  consistently estimated by OLS but the estimator is biased toward zero.
  This bias is roughly \(E(\widehat{\beta}_1) = 1 - 5.3/T\) which is
  substantial for sample sizes typically encountered in macroeconomics.
  This estimation bias causes forecasts of \(Y_t\) to perform worse than
  a pure random walk model.
\item
  Non-normally distributed \(t\)-statistics:

  The nonnormal distribution of the estimated coefficient of a
  stochastic regressor translates to a nonnormal distribution of its
  \(t\)-statistic so that normal critical values are invalid and
  therefore usual confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are invalid,
  too, and the true distribution of the \(t\)-statistic cannot be
  readily determined.
\item
  Spurious Regression:

  When a time series that exhibits a stochastic trend is regressed on
  another time series that does have a stochastic trend too, the
  estimated relationship may appear highly significant although the
  series are unrelated. This is what econometricians call a
  \emph{spurious} relationship.
\end{itemize}

As an example for spurious regression, consider again the green and the
red random walks that we have simulated above. We know that there is no
relationship between both series: they are purely random and independent
of each other.

The result is obviously spurious: the coefficient on \(Green_{t-1}\) is

\(1.14 \cdot 10^{-10}\) of the corresponding \(t\)-test indicates that
the coefficient is highly significant while its true value is in fact
zero.

which is surprisingly quite different from \eqref{eq:urjpip1} which
indicates a moderate positive relationship, in contrast to the large
negative coefficient in \eqref{eq:urjpip2}. This phenomenon can be
attributed to stochastic trends in the series: since there is no
economic reasoning that relates both trends, both regressions are
spurious.

\subsubsection*{Testing for a Unit AR
Root}\label{testing-for-a-unit-ar-root}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Testing for a Unit AR Root}

A formal test for a stochastic trend has been proposed by
\citet{dickey1979} which thus is termed the \emph{Dickey-Fuller test}.
As discussed above, a time series that follows an AR(\(1\)) model with
\(\beta_1 = 1\) has a stochastic trend. Thus, the testing problem is

\begin{align*}
  H_0: \beta_1 = 1 \ \ \ \text{vs.} \ \ \ H_1: \beta_1 < 1.
\end{align*}

The null hypothesis is that the AR(\(1\)) has a unit root and the
alternative hypothesis is that it is stationary. One often rewrites the
AR(\(1\)) by subtracting \(Y_{t-1}\) on both sides:

\begin{align*}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t \ \ \Leftrightarrow \ \ \Delta Y_t = \beta_0 + \delta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_i
\end{align*}

where \(\delta_1 = \beta_1 - 1\). The testing problem then becomes

\begin{align*}
  H_0: \delta_1 = 0 \ \ \ \text{vs.} \ \ \ H_1: \beta_1 < 0
\end{align*}

which is convenient since the corresponding test statistic is reported
by many relevant \texttt{R} functions.\footnote{The \(t\)-statistic of
  the Dickey-Fuller test is computed using homoskedasticity-only
  standard errors since under the null hypothesis, the usual
  \(t\)-statistic is robust to heteroskedasticity.}

The Dickey-Fuller test can also be applied in an AR(\(p\)) model. The
\emph{Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test} is summarized in Key Concept
14.8.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The ADF Test for a Unit Root]{14.8}
Consider the regression
\begin{align}
  \Delta Y_t = \beta_0 + \delta Y_{t-1} + \gamma_1 \Delta_1 Y_{t-1} + \gamma_2 \Delta Y_{t-2} + \dots + \gamma_p \Delta Y_{t-p} + u_t. \label{eq:ADFreg1}
\end{align}

The ADF test for a unit autoregressive root tests the hypothesis $H_0: \delta = 0$ (stochastic trend) against the one-sided alternative $H_1: \delta < 0$ (stationarity) using the usual OLS $t$-statistic.\newline

If it is assumed that $Y_t$ is stationary around a deterministic linear time trend, the model is augmented by the regressor $t$, that is $Y_t$ becomes
\begin{align}
  \Delta Y_t = \beta_0 + at + \delta Y_{t-1} + \gamma_1 \Delta_1 Y_{t-1} + \gamma_2 \Delta Y_{t-2} + \dots + \gamma_p \Delta Y_{t-p} + u_t,  \label{eq:ADFreg2}
\end{align}
where again $H_0: \delta = 0$ is tested against $H_1: \delta < 0$.\newline

The optimal lag length $p$ can be estimated using information criteria. Notice that in the regression (\ref{eq:ADFreg1}), $p=0$ (no lags of $\Delta Y_t$ are used as regressors) corresponds to a simple AR($1$).\newline

Under the null hypothesis, the $t$-statistic corresponding to $H_0: \delta = 0$ does not have a normal distribution. The critical values can only be obtained from simulation and differ for regressions (\ref{eq:ADFreg1}) and (\ref{eq:ADFreg2}) since the distribution of the ADF test statistic is sensitive to the deterministic components included in the regression.

\subsubsection*{Critical Values for the ADF
Statistic}\label{critical-values-for-the-adf-statistic}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Critical Values for the ADF
Statistic}

Key Concept 14.8 states that the critical values for the ADF test in the
regressions \eqref{eq:ADFreg1} and \eqref{eq:ADFreg2} can only be determined
using simulation. The idea of the simulation study is to simulate a
large number of ADF test test statistics and use them to estimate
quantiles of their \emph{asymptotic} distribution. This section shows
how this is feasible within \texttt{R}.

First, consider an AR(\(1\)) model with drift. The procedure is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simulate \(N\) random walks with \(n\) observations using the data
  generating process

  \begin{align*}
    Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t,
  \end{align*}

  \(t=1,\dots,n\) where \(N\) and \(n\) are large numbers.
\item
  For each random walk, estimate the regression

  \begin{align*}
    \Delta Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t
  \end{align*}

  and compute ADF test statistic. Save all \(N\) test statistics in a
  vector.
\item
  Estimate quantiles of the distribution of the ADF test statistic using
  the \(N\) test statistics obtained from the simulation.
\end{itemize}

For the case with drift and linear time trend we replace the data
generating process by

\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \alpha t + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align*}

and estimate

\begin{align*}
  \Delta Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \alpha t + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + u_t.
\end{align*}

Loosely speaking, the precision of the estimated quantiles depends on
two factors: \(n\), the length of the underlying series and \(N\), the
number of test statistics used. Since we are interested in estimating
quantiles of the \emph{asymptotic} distribution (the Dickey-Fuller
distribution) of the ADF test statistic so both using many observations
and large number of simulated test statistics will increase the
precision of the estimated quantiles. We choose \(n=N=1000\) as the
computational burden grows quickly with \(n\) and \(N\).

The results show that using standard normal critical values might be
fatal: the 5\% critical value of the standard normal distribution is
\(-1.64\) but for the Dickey-Fuller distributions the estimated critical
values are \(-2.87\) (drift) and \(-3.43\) (drift and linear time
trend). This implies that a true null hypothesis (the series has a
stochastic trend) would be rejected far to often if the inappropriate
normal critical values were used.

We may use the simulated test statistics for a graphical comparison of

The estimation yields

\begin{align*}
  \Delta\log(GDP_t) =& \, \underset{(0.118)}{0.28} + \underset{(0.0001)}{0.0002} t -\underset{(0.014)}{0.033} \log(GDP_{t-1}) \\

\end{align*}

so the ADF test statistic is \(t=-0.033/0.014 = - 2.35\). The
corresponding \(5\%\) critical value from table \ref{tab:DFcrits} is
\(-3.41\) so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that \(\log(GDP)\) has
a stochastic trend in favor of the alternative that it is stationary
around a deterministic linear time trend.

\section{Nonstationarity II: Breaks}\label{niib}

When there are discrete (at a distinct date) or gradual (over time)
changes in the population regression coefficients, the series is
nonstationary. These changes are called \emph{breaks}. There is a
variety of reasons why breaks can occur in macroeconomic time series but
most often them are related to changes in economic policy or major
changes in the structure of the economy. See Chapter 14.7 of the book
for a discussion of examples.

If breaks are not accounted for in the regression model, OLS estimates
will reflect the average relationship. Since these estimates might be
strongly misleading and result in poor forecast quality, we are
interested in testing for breaks. One distinguishes between testing for
a break when the date is known and testing for a break with an unknown
break date.

Let \(\tau\) denote a known break date and let \(D_t(\tau)\) be a binary
variable indicating time periods before and after the break.
Incorporating the break in an ADL(\(1\),\(1\)) regression model yields

\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \delta_1 X_{t-1} + \gamma_0 D_t(\tau) + \left[ D_t(\tau) Y_{t-1}\right] \\ &+ \, \gamma_2\left[ D_t(\tau) X_{t-1} \right] + u_t,
\end{align*}

where we allow for discrete changes in \(\beta_0\), \(\beta_1\) and
\(\beta_2\) at the break date \(\tau\). The null hypothesis of no break,
\[H_0: \gamma_0=\gamma_1=\gamma_2=0,\] can be tested against the
alternative that at least one of the \(\gamma\)'s is not zero using an
\(F\)-Test. This idea is called a Chow test after Gregory
\citet{chow1960}.

When the break date is unknown the \emph{Quandt likelihood ratio} (QLR)
\emph{test} \citep{quandt1960} may be used. It is a modified version of
the Chow test which uses the largest of all \(F\)-statistics obtained
when applying the Chow test for all possible break dates in a
predetermined range \(\left[\tau_0,\tau_1\right]\). The QLR test is
summarized in Key Concept 14.9.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The QLR Test for Coefficient Stability]{14.9}
The QLR test can be used to test for a break in the population regression function if the date of the break is unknown. The QLR test statistic is the largest (Chow) $F(\tau)$ statistic computed over a range of eligible break dates  $\tau_0 \leq \tau \leq \tau_1$:
\begin{align}
  QLR = \max\left[F(\tau_0),F(\tau_0 +1),\dots,F(\tau_1)\right]. \label{eq:QLRstatistic}
\end{align}\vspace{0.5cm}
The most important properties are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The QLR test can be applied to test whether a subset of the coefficients in the population regression function breaks but the test also rejects if there is a slow evolution of the regression function. 
\item When there is a single discrete break in the population regression function, the $QLR$ test statistic is $F(\widehat{\tau})$ and $\widehat{\tau}/T$ is a consistent estimator of the true break date.
\item The large-sample distribution of $QLR$ depends on $q$, the number of restrictions being tested and both ratios of end points to the sample size, $\tau_0/T, \tau_1/T$. 
\item Similar to the ADF test, the large-sample distribution of $QLR$ is nonstandard. Critical values are presented in Table 14.5 of the book.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

\subsubsection*{Has the Predictive Power of the term spread been
stable?}\label{has-the-predictive-power-of-the-term-spread-been-stable}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Has the Predictive Power of the
term spread been stable?}

Using the QLR statistic we may test whether there is a break in the
coefficients on the lags of the term spread in \eqref{eq:gdpgradl22}, the
ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) regression model of GDP growth. Following Key Concept
14.9 we modify the specification of \eqref{eq:gdpgradl22} by adding a
break dummy \(D(\tau)\) and its interactions with both lags of term
spread and choose the range of break points to be tested as 1970:Q1 -
2005:Q2 (these periods are the center 70\% of the sample data from
1962:Q2 - 2012:Q4). Thus, the model becomes

\begin{align*}
    GDPGR_t =&\, \beta_0 + \beta_1 GDPGR_{t-1} + \beta_2 GDPGR_{t-2} \\
            +&\,  \beta_3  TSpread_{t-1} + \beta_4 TSpread_{t-2} \\
            +&\, \gamma_1 D(\tau) + \gamma_2 (D(\tau) TSpread_{t-1}) \\
            +&\, \gamma_3 (D(\tau) TSpread_{t-2}) \\
            +&\, u_t.
\end{align*}

Next, we estimate the model for each break point and compute the
\(F\)-statistic corresponding to the null hypothesis
\(H_0: \gamma_1=\gamma_2=\gamma_3=0\). The \(QLR\)-statistic is the
largest of the \(F\)-statistics obtained in this manner.

Since \(q=3\) hypotheses are tested and the central \(70\%\) of the
sample are considered to contain breaks, the corresponding \(1\%\)
critical value of the \(QLR\) test is \(6.02\). We reject the null
hypothesis that all coefficients (the coefficients on both lags of term
spread and the intercept) are stable since the computed
\(QLR\)-statistic exceeds this threshold. Thus evidence from the \(QLR\)
test suggests that there is a break in the ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) model of GDP
growth in the early 1980s.

To reproduce Figure 14.5 of the book, we convert the vector of
sequential break-point \(F\)-statistics into a time series object and

\subsubsection*{Pseudo Out-of-Sample
Forecasting}\label{pseudo-out-of-sample-forecasting}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Pseudo Out-of-Sample Forecasting}

Pseudo out-of-sample forecasts are used to simulate the out-of-sample
performance (the real time forecast performance) of a time series
regression model. In particular, pseudo out-of-sample forecast allow
estimation of the \(RMSFE\) of the model and enable researchers to
compare different model specifications with respect to their
reliability. Key Concept 14.10 summarizes this idea.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Pseudo Out-of-Sample Forecasting]{14.10}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Divide the sample data into $s=T-P$ and $P$ subsequent observations. The $P$ observations are used as pseudo-out-of-sample observations.
\item Estimate the model using the first $s$ observations. 
\item Compute the pseudo-forecast $\overset{\sim}{Y}_{s+1\vert s}$.
\item Compute the pseudo-forecast-error $\overset{\sim}{u}_{s+1} = Y_{s+1} - \overset{\sim}{Y}_{s+1\vert s}$.
\item Repeat steps 2 trough 4 for all remaining pseudo-out-of-sample dates.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Did the Predictive Power of the Term Spread Change
During the
2000s?}\label{did-the-predictive-power-of-the-term-spread-change-during-the-2000s}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Did the Predictive Power of the
Term Spread Change During the 2000s?}

The insight gained in the previous section gives reason to presume that
the pseudo-out-of-sample performance of ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) models
estimated using data after the break in the early 1980s should not
deteriorate: provided that the coefficients of the population regression
function are stable after the potential break in 1980:Q4, these models
should have good predictive power. We check this by computing
pseudo-out-of-sample forecasts for the period 2003:Q1 - 2012:Q4, a range
covering 40 periods, where the forecast for 2003:Q1 is done using data
from 1981:Q1 - 2002:Q4, the forecast for 2003:Q2 is based on data from
1981:Q1 - 2003:Q1 and so on.

Similarly as for the \(QLR\)-test we use a \texttt{for()} loop for
estimation of all 40 models and gather their \(SER\)s and the obtained
forecasts in a vector which is then used to compute pseudo-out-of-sample
forecast errors.

Apparently, the pseudo forecasts track the actual GDP growth rate quite
well, except for the kink in 2009 which can be attributed to the recent
financial crisis.

The \(SER\) of the first model (estimated using data from 1981:Q1 to
2002:Q4) is \(2.39\) so based on the in-sample fit we would expect the
out of sample forecast errors to have mean zero and a mean squared
forecast error of about \(2.39\).

forecasts is somewhat larger.

An interesting hypothesis is whether the mean forecast error is zero,
that is the ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) forecasts are right, on average. This
hypothesis is easily tested using the function \texttt{t.test()}.

##  -1.5078876  0.1984001
## sample estimates:

\end{verbatim}

The hypothesis cannot be rejected at the \(10\%\) significance level.
Altogether the analysis suggests that the ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) model
coefficients have been stable since the presumed break in the early
1980s.

\section{Can You Beat the Market? (Part
II)}\label{can-you-beat-the-market-part-ii}

The dividend yield (the ratio of current dividends to the stock price)
can be considered as an indicator of future dividends: if a stock has a
high current dividend yield, it can be considered undervalued and it can
be presumed that the price of the stock goes up in the future, meaning
that future excess returns go up.

This presumption can be examined using ADL models of excess returns,
where lags of the logarithm of the stock's dividend yield serve as
additional regressors.

Unfortunately, a graphical inspection of the time series of the
logarithm of the dividend yield casts doubt on the assumption that the
series is stationary which, as has been discussed in Chapter \ref{nit},
is necessary to obtain meaningful results in a regression analysis.

Since the \(t\)-value for the coefficient on the lagged logarithm of the
dividend yield is \(-1.27\), the hypothesis that the true coefficient is
zero cannot be rejected, even at the \(10\%\) significance level.

However, it is possible to examine whether the dividend yield has
predictive power for excess returns by using its differences in an
ADL(\(1\),\(1\)) and an ADL(\(2\),\(2\)) model (remember that
differencing a series with a unit root yields a stationary series)
although these model specifications do not correspond to the economic
reasoning mentioned above. Thus we also estimate a ADL(\(1\),\(1\))
regression using the level of the logarithm of the dividend yield.

Altogether we estimate three different model specifications:

\begin{align*}
  excess \, returns_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 excess \, returns_{t-1} + \beta_3 \Delta \log(dividend yield_{t-1}) + u_t \\
  \\
  excess \, returns_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 excess \, returns_{t-1} + \beta_2 excess \, returns_{t-2} \\ +& \, \beta_3 \Delta \log(dividend yield_{t-1}) + \beta_4 \Delta \log(dividend yield_{t-2}) + u_t \\
  \\
  excess \, returns_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 excess \, returns_{t-1} + \beta_5 \log(dividend yield_{t-1}) + u_t \\

Notice that for models (1) and (2) none of the individual
\(t\)-statistics suggest that the coefficients are different from zero.
Also we cannot reject the hypothesis that none of the lags have
predictive power for excess returns at any common level of significance
(an \(F\)-test that the lags have predictive power rejects for both
models).

Things are different for model (3). The coefficient on the level of the
logarithm of the dividend yield is different from zero at the \(5\%\)
level and the \(F\)-test does not reject at this level either. But we
should be suspicious: the high degree of persistence in the dividend
yield series probably renders this inference useless because \(t\)- and
\(F\)-statistics may follow distributions that deviate considerably from
their theoretical large-sample distributions such that the usual
critical values cannot be applied.

If model (3) would be of any use for predicting excess returns,
pseudo-out-of-sample forecasts based on (3) should outperform forecasts
of an intercept-only model in terms of the sample RMSFE. We can perform
this type of comparison using \texttt{R} code in the fashion of the

The comparison indicates that model (3) is not useful since it is
outperformed in terms of sample RMSFE by the intercept-only model. A
model forecasting excess returns always to be zero has an even lower
sample RMSFE. This finding is consistent with the strong-form efficiency
hypothesis which states that all publicly available information is
accounted for in stock prices such that there is no way to predict
future stock prices or excess returns using past observations, implying
that the perceived significant relationship indicated by model (3) is
wrong.

\subsubsection*{Summary}\label{summary-6}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Summary}

This chapter dealt with introductory topics in time series regression
analysis, where variables are generally correlated from one observation
to the next, a concept termed serial correlation. At the beginning,
several ways of storing and plotting time series data using \texttt{R}
have been presented and used for informal analysis of economic example
data.

We have introduced AR and ADL models and applied them in the context of
forecasting of macroeconomic and financial time series using \texttt{R}.
The discussion also included the topic of lag length selection. It was
shown how to set up a simple function that computes the BIC for a model
object supplied.

We have also seen how to write simple \texttt{R} code for performing and
evaluating forecasts and demonstrated some more sophisticated approaches
to conduct pseudo-out-of-sample forecasts for assessment of a model's
predictive power for unobserved future outcomes of a series, to check
model stability and to compare different models.

Furthermore, some more technical aspects like the concept of
stationarity were addressed. This included applications to testing for
an autoregressive unit root with the Dickey-Fuller test and the
detection of a break in the population regression function using the
\(QLR\) statistic. For both methods, the distribution of the relevant
test statistic is non-normal, even in large samples. Concerning the
Dickey-Fuller test we have used \texttt{R}'s random number generation
facilities to produce evidence for this by means of a Monte-Carlo
simulation and motivated usage of the quantiles tabulated in the book.

Also, empirical studies regarding the validity of the weak and the
strong form efficiency hypothesis which are presented in the
applications \emph{Can You Beat the Market? Part I \& II} in the book
have been reproduced using \texttt{R}.

In all applications presented in this chapter, the focus was layed on
forecasting future outcomes rather than estimation of causal
relationships between time series variables. However, the framework of
methods needed for the latter is very similar. Chapter \ref{eodce} is
devoted to estimation of so called \emph{dynamic causal effects}.

\chapter{Estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects}\label{eodce}

In economic research it sometimes is of interest to know how large the
effect on \(Y\) now and in the future of a change in \(X\) is. This is
called the \emph{dynamic causal effect} on \(Y\) of a change in \(X\).
In this section we will discuss how to estimate dynamic causal effects
by means of several \texttt{R} applications, where we investigate the
dynamic effect of cold weather in Florida on the price of orange juice
concentrate.

The discussion covers:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimation of distributed lag models
\item
  Heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard
  errors
\item
  Generalized least squares (GLS) of ADL models
\end{itemize}

If you would like to reproduce code examples, install the \texttt{R}
packages listed below beforehand and make sure that the subsequent code

\section{The Orange Juice Data}\label{the-orange-juice-data}

The largest cultivation region for oranges in the U.S. is located in
state of Florida which usually has ideal climate for the fruit growth
and thus makes Florida the source of almost all frozen juice concentrate
produced in the country. However, from time to time and depending on
their severeness, cold snaps cause a loss of harvests such that the
supply of oranges decreases and consequently the price of frozen juice
concentrate rises. The timing of the price increases is complicated: a
cut in today's supply of concentrate influences not just today's price
but also future prices because supply in future periods will be
diminished, too. Clearly, the magnitude of today's and the future price
increases due to freeze is an empirical question that can be
investigated using a distributed lag model --- a time series model that
relates price changes to weather conditions.

To begin with the analysis, we reproduce Figure 15.1 of the book which
displays plots of the price index for frozen concentrated orange juice,
percentage changes in the price as well as monthly freezing degree days
in Orlando, the center of Florida's orange-growing region.

It is conspicuous that periods with a high amount of freezing degree
days are followed by large month-to-month price changes. These
coinciding movements motivate to run a simple regression of price
changes (\(\%ChgOJC_t\)) on freezing degree days (\(FDD_t\)) to estimate
the effect of an additional freezing degree day one the price in the
current month. For this, as for all other regressions in this chapter,
we use \(T=611\) observations (January 1950 to December 2000).

Notice that the standard errors are computed using a HAC estimator of
the model variance-covariance matrix, a matter that will not be further
commented at this point, see Chapter \ref{apatadlm} for a discussion of
this estimator.

\begin{align*}
  \widehat{\%ChgOJC_t} = -\underset{(0.19)}{0.42} + \underset{(0.13)}{0.47} FDD_t
\end{align*}

The estimated coefficient on \(FDD_t\) has the following interpretation:
an additional freezing degree day in month \(t\) leads to a price
increase 0f \(0.47\%\) in the same month.

To consider effects of cold snaps on the orange juice price over the
subsequent periods, we include lagged values of \(FDD_t\) in our model
which leads to a so-called \emph{distributed lag regression model}. We
estimate a specification using a contemporaneous and six lagged values
of \(FDD_t\) as regressors.

As the result we obtain

\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  \widehat{\%ChgOJC_t} =& \, -\underset{(0.21)}{0.69} + \underset{(0.14)}{0.47} FDD_t + \underset{(0.08)}{0.15} FDD_{t-1} + \underset{(0.06)}{0.06} FDD_{t-2} + \underset{(0.05)}{0.07} FDD_{t-3} \\ &\,+ \underset{(0.03)}{0.04} FDD_{t-4} + \underset{(0.03)}{0.05} FDD_{t-5} + \underset{(0.05)}{0.05} FDD_{t-6},
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:orangemod1}
\end{align}

where the coefficient on \(FDD_{t-1}\) estimates the price increase in
period \(t\) caused by an additional freezing degree day in the
preceding month, the coefficient on \(FDD_{t-2}\) estimates the effect
of an additional freezing degree day two month ago and so on.
Consequently, the coefficients in \eqref{eq:orangemod1} can be interpreted
as price changes in current and future periods due to a unit increase in
the current month' freezing degree days.

\section{Dynamic Causal Effects}\label{dynamic-causal-effects}

This section of the book describes the general idea of a dynamic causal
effect and how the concept of a randomized controlled experiment, which
(as has been discussed in Chapter \ref{eaqe}) constitutes an ideal study
design and can be translated to time series applications, using several
examples. For brevity we will not go into the details but note once
again that the distributed lag model mentioned above can often be used
to estimate a dynamic causal relationship.

In general, for empirical attempts to measure a dynamic causal effect,
the assumptions of stationarity (see Key Concept 14.5) and exogeneity
must hold. In time series applications up until here we have assumed
that the model error term has conditional mean zero given current and
past values of the regressors. For estimation of a dynamic causal effect
using a distributed lag model, assuming a stronger form termed
\emph{strict exogeneity} may be useful. Strict exogeneity states that
the error term has mean zero conditional on past, present \emph{and
future} values of the independent variables.

The two concepts of exogeneity and the distributive lag model are
summarized in Key Concept 15.1.

\begin{keyconcepts}[The Distributed Lag Model and Exogeneity]{15.1}
The general distributed lag model is
\begin{align}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 X_{t-1} + \beta_3 X_{t-2} + \dots + \beta_{r+1} X_{t-r} + u_t, \label{eq:dlm}
\end{align}
where it is assumed that \newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is an exogenous variable, $$E(u_t\vert X_t, X_{t-1}, X_{t-2},\dots) = 0.$$
\item \vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $X_t,Y_t$ have a stationary distribution.
\item[(b)] $(Y_t,X_t)$ and $(Y_{t-j},X_{t-j})$ become independently distributed as $j$ gets large.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.5cm}
\item Large outliers are unlikely. In particular, we need that all the variables have more than eight nonzero and finite moments --- a stronger assumption than before (four finite nonzero moments) that is required for computation of the HAC covariance matrix estimator.
\item There is no perfect multicollinearity.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

The distributed lag model may be extended to include contemporaneous and past values of additional regressors.\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{On the assumption of exogeneity}\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is another form of exogeneity termed \textit{strict exogeneity} which assumes $$E(u_t\vert \dots, X_{t+2},X_{t+1},X_t,X_{t-1},X_{t-2},\dots)=0,$$ that is the error term has mean zero conditional on past, present and future values of $X$. Strict exogeneity implies exogeneity (as defined in 1. above) but not the other way around. From this point on we will therefore distinguish between exogeneity and strict exogeneity. 
\item Exogeneity as in 1. suffices for the OLS estimators of the coefficient in distributed lag models to be consistent. However, if the the assumption of strict exogeneity is valid, more efficient estimators can be applied.
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcepts}

\section{Dynamic Multipliers and Cumulative Dynamic
Multipliers}\label{dynamic-multipliers-and-cumulative-dynamic-multipliers}

The following terminology regarding the coefficients in the distributed
lag model \eqref{eq:dlm} is useful for upcoming applications:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The dynamic causal effect is also called the \emph{dynamic
  multiplier}. We say that \(\beta_{h+1}\) in \eqref{eq:dlm} is the
  \(h\)-period dynamic multiplier.
\item
  The contemporaneous effect of \(X\) on \(Y\), \(\beta_1\), is termed
  the \emph{impact effect}.
\item
  The \(h\)-period \emph{cumulative dynamic multiplier} of a unit change
  in \(X\) and \(Y\) is defined as the cumulative sum of the dynamic
  multipliers. In particular, \(\beta_1\) is the zero-period cumulative
  dynamic multiplier, \(\beta_1 + \beta_2\) is the one-period cumulative
  dynamic multiplier and so forth.

  The cumulative dynamic multipliers of the distributed lag model
  \eqref{eq:dlm} are the coefficients
  \(\delta_1,\delta_2,\dots,\delta_r,\delta_{r+1}\) in the modified
  regression

  \begin{align}
    Y_t =& \, \delta_0 + \delta_1 \Delta X_t + \delta_2 \Delta X_{t-1} + \dots + \delta_r \Delta X_{t-r+1} + \delta_{r+1} X_{t-r} + u_t \label{eq:DCMreg}
  \end{align}

  and thus can be directly estimated using OLS which makes it convenient
  to compute their HAC standard errors. \(\delta_{r+1}\) is called the
  \emph{long-run dynamic multiplier}.
\end{itemize}

It is straightforward to compute the cumulative dynamic multipliers for
\eqref{eq:orangemod1}, the estimated distributed lag regression of changes
in orange juice concentrate prices on freezing degree days, using the
corresponding model object \texttt{orange\_DLM} and the function
\texttt{cumsum()}.

\eqref{eq:DCMreg}, we see that the OLS coefficient estimates in this model
coincide with the multipliers stored in \texttt{cum\_mult}.

\section{HAC Standard Errors}\label{hac-standard-errors}

The error term \(u_t\) in the distributed lag model \eqref{eq:dlm} may be
serially correlated due to serially correlated determinants of \(Y_t\)
that are not included as regressors. When these factors are not
correlated with the regressors included in the model, serially
correlated errors do not violate the assumption of exogeneity such that
the OLS estimator remains unbiased and consistent.

However, autocorrelated standard errors render the usual
homoskedasticity-only \emph{and} heteroskedasticity-robust standard
errors invalid and may cause misleading inference. HAC errors are a
remedy for this issue.

\begin{keyconcepts}[HAC Standard errors]{15.2}
\textbf{Problem}:\newline

If the error term $u_t$ in the distributed lag model (\ref{eq:dlm}) is serially correlated, statistical inference that rests on usual (heteroskedasticity-robust) standard errors can be strongly misleading.\newline

\textbf{Solution}:\newline

Heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) estimators of the variance-covariance matrix circumvent this issue. There are \texttt{R} functions like \texttt{vcovHAC()} from the package \texttt{sandwich} which are convenient for computation of such estimators.\newline

The package \texttt{sandwich} also contains the function \texttt{NeweyWest()}, an implementation of the HAC variance-covariance estimator proposed by \cite{newey1987}.
\end{keyconcepts}

Consider the distributed lag regression model with no lags and a single
regressor \(X_t\)

\begin{align*}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t + u_t.
\end{align*}

with autocorrelated errors. A brief derivation of

\begin{align}
  \overset{\sim}{\sigma}^2_{\widehat{\beta}_1} = \widehat{\sigma}^2_{\widehat{\beta}_1} \widehat{f}_t \label{eq:nwhac}
\end{align}

the so-called \emph{Newey-West variance estimator} for the variance of
the OLS estimator of \(\beta_1\) is presented in Chapter 15.4 of the
book. \(\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\widehat{\beta}_1}\) in \eqref{eq:nwhac} is
the heteroskedasticity-robust variance estimate of \(\widehat{\beta}_1\)
and

\begin{align}
  \widehat{f}_t = 1 + 2 \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \left(\frac{m-j}{m}\right) \overset{\sim}{\rho}_j \label{eq:nwhacf}
\end{align}

is a correction factor that adjusts for serially correlated errors and
involves estimates of \(m-1\) autocovariances
\(\overset{\sim}{\rho}_j\), whereby \(m\) is a truncation parameter to
be chosen. A rule of thumb for choosing \(m\) is

\begin{align}
  m = \left \lceil{0.75 \cdot T^{1/3}}\right\rceil. \label{eq:hactruncrot}
\end{align}

In the following we simulate a time series that, as stated above,
follows a distributed lag model with autocorrelated errors and then show
how to compute the Newey-West HAC estimate of \(SD(\widehat{\beta}_1)\)
using \texttt{R}. This is done in two separate but, as we will see,
identical approaches: at first we follow the derivation presented in the
book step-by-step and compute the estimate manually. We then show that
the result is exactly the estimate obtained when using the function
\texttt{NeweyWest()}.

\section{Estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects with Strictly Exogeneous
Regressors}\label{estimation-of-dynamic-causal-effects-with-strictly-exogeneous-regressors}

In general, the errors in a distributed lag model are correlated which
necessitates usage of HAC standard errors for valid inference. If,
however, the assumption of exogeneity (the first assumption stated in
Key Concept 15.1) is replaced by strict exogeneity, that is
\[E(u_t\vert \dots, X_{t+1}, X_{t}, X_{t-1}, \dots) = 0,\] more
efficient approaches than OLS estimation of the coefficients are
available. For a general distributed lag model with \(r\) lags and
AR(\(p\)) errors, these approaches are summarized in Key Concept 15.4.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Estimation of Dynamic Multipliers Under Strict Exogeneity]{15.4}
Consider the general distributed lag model with $r$ lags and assume that the errors follow an AR($p$) process,
\begin{align}
  Y_t =& \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 X_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_{r+1} X_{t-r} + u_t \\
  u_t =& \, \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \phi u_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p u_{t-p} + \overset{\sim}{u}_t. \label{eq:dlmarerrors}
\end{align}
Under strict exogeneity of $X_t$, one may rewrite the above model in the ADL specification
\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \, \alpha_0 + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p Y_{t-p} \\
      +& \, \delta_0 X_t + \delta_1 X_{t-1} + \dots + \delta_q X_{t-q} + \overset{\sim}{u}_t
\end{align*}
where $q=r+p$ and compute estimates of the dynamic multipliers $\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_{r+1}$ using OLS estimates of $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_p, \delta_0, \delta_1, \dots, \delta_q$.\newline 

An alternative is to estimate the dynamic multipliers using feasible GLS, that is to apply the OLS estimator to a quasi-difference specification of (\ref{eq:dlmarerrors}). Under strict exogeneity, the feasible GLS approach is the BLUE estimator for the dynamic multipliers in large samples.\newline

On the one hand, as demonstrated in Chapter 15.5 of the book, the OLS estimation of the ADL representation can be beneficial for estimation of the dynamic multipliers in large distributed lag models because it allows for a more parsimonious model that may be a good approximation to a large distributed lag model. On the other hand, the GLS approach is more efficient than the ADL estimator if the sample size is large.
\end{keyconcepts}

In what follows we shortly review how the different representations of a
distributed lag model can be obtained when the causal effect in \(Y\) of
a change in \(X\) lasts for only two periods and show how these
specification can be estimated by OLS and GLS using \texttt{R}.

The model is

\begin{align}
  Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 X_{t-1} + u_t, \label{eq:dldynamic}
\end{align}

so a change in \(X\) is modeled to effect \(Y\) contemporaneously
(\(\beta_1\)) and in the next period (\(\beta_2\)). The error term
\(u_t\) is assumed to follow an AR(\(1\))
process,\[u_t = \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \overset{\sim}{u_t},\] where
\(\overset{\sim}{u_t}\) is serially uncorrelated.

One can show that the ADL representation of this model is

\begin{align}
  Y_t = \alpha_0 + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \delta_0 X_t + \delta_1 X_{t-1} + \delta_2 X_{t-2} + \overset{\sim}{u}_t, \label{eq:adl21dynamic}
\end{align}

with the restrictions

\begin{align*}
  \beta_1 =& \, \delta_0, \\
  \beta_2 =& \, \delta_1 + \phi_1 \delta_0.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Quasi-Differences}\label{quasi-differences}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Quasi-Differences}

Another way of writing the ADL(\(1\),\(2\)) representation
\eqref{eq:adl21dynamic} is the \emph{quasi-difference model}

\begin{align}
  \overset{\sim}{Y}_t = \alpha_0 + \beta_1 \overset{\sim}{X}_t + \beta_2   \overset{\sim}{X}_{t-1} + \overset{\sim}{u}_t, \label{eq:qdm}
\end{align}

where \(\overset{\sim}{Y}_t = Y_t - \phi_1 Y_{t-1}\) and
\(\overset{\sim}{X}_t = X_t - \phi_1 X_{t-1}\). Notice that the error
term \(\overset{\sim}{u}_t\) is uncorrelated in both models and, as
shown in Chapter 15.5 of the book,
\[E(u_t\vert X_{t+1}, X_t, X_{t-1}, \dots) = 0,\] which is implied by
the assumption of strict exogeneity.

We continue by simulating a time series of \(500\) observations using
the model \eqref{eq:dldynamic} with \(\beta_1 = 0.1\), \(\beta_2 = 0.25\),
\(\phi = 0.5\) and \(\overset{\sim}{u}_t \sim N(0,1)\) and estimate the
different representations, starting with the distributed lag model
\eqref{eq:dldynamic}.

The plot indicates that the residuals are autocorrelated. In particular,
the pattern observed reveals that the residuals follow an autoregressive
process, as the sample autocorrelation function decays quickly for the
first few lags and is probably zero for higher lag orders. At any case,
HAC standard errors should be used.

\paragraph{GLS Estimation}\label{gls-estimation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{GLS Estimation}

Strict exogeneity allows OLS estimation of the quasi-difference model
\eqref{eq:qdm}. The idea of applying the OLS estimator to a model where
the variables are linearly transformed, such that the model errors are
uncorrelated and homoskedastic, is called \emph{generalized least
squares} (GLS)

The OLS estimator in \eqref{eq:qdm} is called the \emph{infeasible GLS}
estimator because \(\overset{\sim}{Y}\) and \(\overset{\sim}{X}\) cannot
be computed without knowing \(\phi_1\), the autoregressive coefficient
in the error AR(\(1\)) model, which is generally unknown in practice.

Suppose we know that \(\phi = 0.5\). We then may obtain the infeasible
GLS estimates of the dynamic multipliers in \eqref{eq:dldynamic} by
applying OLS to the transformed data.

coefficients in the presumed error term model, computes the
quasi-differenced data and then estimates the model using OLS. This idea

Feasible GLS is the BLUE of the dynamic multipliers when there is serial
correlation and/or heteroskedasticity. Notice that in this example, the
coefficient estimates produced by GLS are somewhat closer to their true
values and that the standard errors are the smallest for the GLS
estimator.

\section{Orange Juice Prices and Cold
Weather}\label{orange-juice-prices-and-cold-weather}

In this section we investigate the following two questions using the
time series regression methods discussed in the previous sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How persistent is the effect of a single freeze on orange juice
  concentrate prices?
\item
  Has the effect been stable over the whole time span?
\end{itemize}

We start by estimating dynamic causal effects with a distributed lag
model where \(\%ChgOJC_t\) is regressed on \(FDD_t\) and 18 lags of it.
A second model specification we consider is a transformation of the the
distributed lag model which allows to estimate the 19 cumulative dynamic
multipliers using OLS. In a third model, we add 11 binary variables (one
for each of the months from February to December) to adjust for a
possible omitted variable bias arising from correlation of \(FDD_t\) and
seasons by adding \texttt{season(FDD)} to the right hand side of the
formula of the second model.

The models above include a large number of lags with default labels that
correspond to the degree of differencing and the lag orders which makes
it somewhat cumbersome to read the outcomes. The regressor labels of a
model object may be altered by overriding the attribute \texttt{names}
of the coefficient section using the function \texttt{attr()}. Thus, for
better readability we use the lag orders as regressor labels.

Next, we compute HAC standard errors standard errors for each model
using \(NeweyWest()\) and gather the results in a list which is then
supplied as the argument \texttt{se} to the function
\texttt{stargazer()}, see below. Note that the sample consists of 612
observations.

According to \eqref{eq:hactruncrot}, the rule of thumb for choosing the
HAC standard error truncation parameter \(m\), we choose
\[m = \left\lceil0.75 \cdot 612^{1/3} \right\rceil = \lceil6.37\rceil = 7.\]
To check for sensitivity of the standard errors to different choices of
the truncation parameter in the model that is used to estimate the
cumulative multipliers, we also compute the Newey-West estimator for
\(m=14\).

According to column (1) of Table \ref{tab:deoafddotpooj}, the
contemporaneous effect of a freezing degree day is an increase of
\(0.5\%\) in orange juice prices. The estimated effect is only
\(0.17\%\) for the next month and close to zero for subsequent months.
In fact, for all lags larger than 1, we cannot reject the null
hypotheses that the respective coefficients are zero using individual
\(t\)-tests. Notice also that the model \texttt{FOJC\_mod\_DM} does only
explain little of the variation in the dependent variable
(\(\overline{R}^2 = 0.11\)).

Columns (2) and (3) present estimates of the dynamic cumulative
multipliers of model \texttt{FOJC\_mod\_CM1}. Apparently, it does not
matter whether we choose \(m=7\) or \(m=14\) when computing HAC standard
errors so we stick with \(m=7\) and the standard errors reported in
column (2).

If the demand for orange juice is higher in winter, \(FDD_t\) would be
correlated with the error term since freezes occur rather in winter so
we would face omitted variable bias. The third model estimate,
\texttt{FOJC\_mod\_CM2}, accounts for this possible issue by using an
additional set of 11 monthly dummies. For brevity, estimates of the
dummy coefficients are excluded from the output produced by stargazer
(this is achieved by setting \texttt{omit = 'season'}). We may check
that the dummy for January was omitted to prevent perfect
multicollinearity.

A comparison of the estimates presented in columns (3) and (4) indicates
that adding monthly dummies has a negligible effect. Further evidence
for this comes from a joint test of the hypothesis that the 11 dummy
coefficients are zero. Instead of using \texttt{linearHypothesis()}
which requires that all 11 restrictions are provided in a matrix, we use
the function \texttt{waldtest()} and supply two model objects instead:
\texttt{unres\_model}, the unrestricted model object which is the same
as \texttt{FOJC\_mod\_CM2} (except for the coefficient names since we
have modified them above) and \texttt{res\_model}, the model where the
restriction that all dummy coefficients are zero is imposed.
\texttt{res\_model} is conveniently obtained using the function
\texttt{update()}. It extracts the argument \texttt{formula} of a model
object, updates it as specified and then re-fits the model. By setting
\texttt{formula = . \textasciitilde{} . - season(FDD)} we impose that
the monthly dummies do not enter the model.

\end{verbatim}

The \(p\)-value is \(0.47\) so we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
coefficients on the monthly dummies are zero, even at the \(10\%\) level
of significance. We conclude that the seasonal fluctuations in demand
for orange juice do not pose a serious threat to internal validity of
the model.

It is convenient to use plots of dynamic multipliers and cumulative
dynamic multipliers. The following two code chunks reproduce Figures

As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:DCM}, the estimated dynamic
cumulative multipliers grow until the seventh month up to a price
increase of about \(0.91\%\) and then decrease slightly to the estimated
long-run cumulative multiplier of \(0.37\%\) which, however, is not
significantly different from zero at the \(5\%\) level.

Have the dynamic multipliers been stable over time? One way to see this
is to estimate these multipliers for different subperiods of the sample
span. For example, consider periods 1950 - 1966, 1967 - 1983 and 1984 -
2000. If the multipliers are the same for all three periods the
estimates should be close and thus the estimated cumulative multipliers
should be similar, too. We investigate this by re-estimating
\texttt{FOJC\_mod\_CM1} for the three different time spans and then plot
the estimated cumulative dynamic multipliers for the comparison.

Clearly, the cumulative dynamic multipliers have changed considerably
over time. Notice that the effect of a freeze was stronger and more
persistent in the 1950s and 1960s. For the 1970s the magnitude of the
effect was lower but still highly persistent. We observe an even lower
magnitude for the final third of the sample span (1984 - 2000) where the
long-run effect is much less persistent and essentially zero after a
year.

Evidence of a QLR test for a break in the population distributed lag
regression of column (1) with \(15\%\) trimming using a HAC
variance-covariance matrix estimate supports the conjecture that the
population regression coefficients have changed over time.

The QLR statistic is \(36.77\). From Table 14.5 of the book we see that
the \(1\%\) critical value for the QLR test with \(15\%\) trimming and
\(q=20\) restrictions is \(2.43\). Since this is a right-sided test, the
QLR statistic clearly lies in the region of rejection so we can discard
the null hypothesis of no break in the population regression function.

See Chapter 15.7 of the book for a discussion of empirical examples
where it is questionable whether the assumption of (past and present)
exogeneity of the regressors is plausible.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-7}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We have seen how \texttt{R} can be used to estimate the time path of
  the effect on \(Y\) of a change in \(X\) (the dynamic causal effect on
  \(Y\) of a change in \(X\)) using time series data on both. The
  corresponding model is called the distributed lag model. Distributed
  lag models are conveniently estimated using the function
  \texttt{dynlm()} from the package \texttt{dynlm}.
\item
  The regression error in distributed lag models is often serially
  correlated such that standard errors which are robust to
  heteroskedasticity \emph{and} autocorrelation should be used to obtain
  valid inference based on \(t\)-statistics and confidence intervals.
  The package \texttt{sandwich} provides functions for computation of
  so-called HAC covariance matrix estimators, for example
  \texttt{vcovHAC()} and \texttt{NeweyWest()}.
\item
  When \(X\) is \emph{strictly exogeneous}, more efficient estimates can
  be obtained using an ADL model or by GLS estimation. Feasible GLS
  algorithms can be found in the \texttt{R} packages \texttt{orcutt} and
  \texttt{nlme}. We have stressed that the assumption of strict
  exogeneity is often implausible in empirical applications. See chapter
  15.7 of the book for further examples.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Additional Topics in Time Series Regression}\label{atitsr}

This chapter discusses the following advanced topics in time series
regression and demonstrates how core techniques can be applied using
\texttt{R}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Vector autoregressions} (VARs). We focus on using VARs for
  forecasting. Another branch of the literature is concerned with
  so-called \emph{Structural VARs} which are, however, beyond the scope
  of this chapter.
\item
  Multiperiod forecasts. This includes a discussion of iterated and
  direct (multivariate) forecasts.
\item
  The DF-GLS test, a more powerful method to test for a unit root than
  the ADF test.
\item
  Cointegration analysis with an application to short- and long-term
  interest rates. We demonstrate how to estimate a vector error
  correction model.
\item
  Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models. We show
  how a simple generalized ARCH (GARCH) model can be helpful in
  quantifying the risk associated with investing in the stock market in
  terms of estimation and forecasting of the volatility of asset
  returns.

\section{Vector Autoregressions}\label{vector-autoregressions}

A Vector autoregressive (VAR) model is useful when one is interested in
predicting multiple time series variables using a single model. At its
core, the VAR model is an extension of the univariate autoregressive
model we have dealt with in Chapters \ref{ittsraf} and \ref{eodce}. Key
Concept 16.1 summarizes the essentials of VAR.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Vector Autoregressions]{16.1}
The vector autoregression (VAR) model extends the idea of univariate autoregression to $k$ time series regressions, where the lagged values of \textit{all} $k$ series appear as regressors. Put differently, in a VAR model we regress a \textit{vector} of time series variables on lagged vectors of these variables. As for AR($p$) models, the lag order is denoted by $p$ so the VAR($p$) model of two variables $X_t$ and $Y_t$ ($k=2$) is given by the equations

\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \, \beta_{10} + \beta_{11} Y_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_{1p} Y_{t-p} + \gamma_{11} X_{t-1} + \dots + \gamma_{1p} X_{t-p} + u_{1t}, \\
  X_t =& \, \beta_{20} + \beta_{21} Y_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_{2p} Y_{t-p} + \gamma_{21} X_{t-1} + \dots + \gamma_{2p} X_{t-p} + u_{2t}.
\end{align*}

The $\alpha$s and $\beta$s can be estimated using OLS on each equation. The assumptions for VARs are the time series assumptions presented in Key Concept 14.6 applied to each of the equations.\newline

It is straightforward to estimate VAR models in \texttt{R}. A feasible approach is to simply use \texttt{lm()} for estimation of the individual equations. Furthermore, the \texttt{R} package \texttt{vars} provides standard tools for estimation, diagnostic testing and prediction using this type of models.  
\end{keyconcepts}

When the assumptions referred to in Key Concept 16.1 hold, the OLS
estimators of the VAR coefficients are consistent and jointly normal in
large samples so that the usual inferential methods such as confidence
intervals and \(t\)-statistics can be used.

Notice that, due to the structure of VARs, we may jointly test
restrictions across multiple equations. For instance, it may be of
interest to test whether the coefficients on all regressors of the lag
\(p\) are zero. This corresponds to testing the null hypothesis that the
lag order \(p-1\) is correct. Large sample joint normality of the
coefficient estimates is a convenient thing because this implies that we
may simply use an \(F\)-test for this testing problem. The explicit
formula for such a test statistic is rather complicated but fortunately
such computations are easily done using the \texttt{R} functions we will
work with for the course of this chapter. Another way for determining
optimal lag lengths are information criteria like the \(BIC\) which we
have introduced for univariate time series regressions. Just as in the
case of a single equation, for a multiple equation model we choose the
specification which has the smallest \(BIC(p)\) where

\begin{align*}
  BIC(p) =& \, \log\left[\text{det}(\widehat{\Sigma}_u)\right] + k(kp+1), \frac{\log(T)}{T}.
\end{align*}

with \(\widehat{\Sigma}_u\) denoting the estimate of the \(k \times k\)
covariance matrix of the VAR errors and \(\text{det}(\cdot)\) denotes
the determinant.

As for univariate distributed lag models, one should think carefully
which variables to include in a VAR because adding unrelated variables
reduces the forecast accuracy by increasing the estimation error. This
is particularly important because the number of parameters to be
estimated grows proportionally to the number of variables modeled by the
VAR. In the application below we shall see that economic theory and
empirical evidence are helpful for this decision.

\paragraph{A VAR Model of the Growth Rate of GDP and the Term
Spread}\label{a-var-model-of-the-growth-rate-of-gdp-and-the-term-spread}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{A VAR Model of the Growth Rate of GDP
and the Term Spread}

In the following we show how to estimate a VAR model of the GDP growth
rate, \(GDPGR\), and the term spread, \(TSpread\). As a consequence to
the discussion on nonstationarity of GDP growth in Chapter \ref{nit}
(remember the possible break in the early 1980s detected by the \(QLR\)
test statistic), we use data from 1981:Q1 to 2012:Q4. The two model
equations are

\begin{align*}
 GDPGR_t =& \, \beta_{10} + \beta_{11} GDPGR_{t-1} + \beta_{12} GDPGR_{t-2} + \gamma_{11} TSpread_{t-1} + \gamma_{12} TSpread_{t-2} + u_{1t}, \\
 TSpread_t =& \, \beta_{20} + \beta_{21} GDPGR_{t-1} + \beta_{22} GDPGR_{t-2} + \gamma_{21} TSpread_{t-1} + \gamma_{22} TSpread_{t-2} + u_{2t}.
\end{align*}

We find that both Granger causality tests reject at the level of
\(5\%\). This is evidence in favor of the conjecture that the term
spread has power in explaining GDP growth and vice versa.

\paragraph{Iterated Multivariate Forecasts using an iterated
VAR}\label{iterated-multivariate-forecasts-using-an-iterated-var}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Iterated Multivariate Forecasts using
an iterated VAR}

The idea of an iterated forecast for period \(T+2\) based on
observations up to period \(T\) is to use the one-period-ahead forecast
as an intermediate step, that is the forecast for period \(T+1\) is used
as an observation when predicting the level of a series for period
\(T+2\). This can be generalized to a \(h\)-period-ahead forecast where
all intervening periods between \(T\) and \(T+h\) must be forecasted as
they are used as observations in the process (see Chapter 16.2 of the
book for a more detailed argument on this concept). Iterated multiperiod
forecasts are summarized in Key Concept 16.2.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Iterated Multiperiod Forecasts]{16.2}
The steps for an \textit{iterated multiperiod AR forecast} are:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the AR($p$) model using OLS and compute the one-period-ahead forecast.
\item Use the one-period-ahead forecast to obtain the two-period-ahead forecast.
\item Continue by iterating to obtain forecasts farther into the future.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{0.5cm}

An \textit{iterated multiperiod VAR forecast} is done as follows:\newline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate the VAR($p$) model using OLS per equation and compute the one-period-ahead forecast for \textit{all} variables in the VAR.
\item Use the one-period-ahead forecasts to obtain the two-period-ahead forecasts.
\item Continue by iterating to obtain forecasts of all variables in the VAR farther into the future.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcepts}

Since in a VAR the variables are modeled using lags of the respective
other variables, we need to compute forecasts for \emph{all} variables.
It can be cumbersome to do so when the VAR is large but fortunately
there are \texttt{R} functions that facilitate this. For example, the
function \texttt{predict()} can be used to obtain iterated multivariate
forecasts for VAR models estimated by the function \texttt{VAR()}.

The following code chunk shows how to compute iterated forecasts for GDP
growth and the term spread up to period 2015:Q1, that is \(h=10\), using
the model object \texttt{VAR\_est}.

From this we can tell that the two-quarter-ahead forecast of GDP growth
in 2013:Q2 using data through 2012:Q4 is \(1.69\). For the same period,
the iterated VAR forecast for the term spread is \(1.88\).

Notice that the matrices returned by \texttt{predict(VAR\_est)} also
include \(95\%\) prediction intervals (however, the function does not
adjust for autocorrelation or heteroskedasticity of the errors!).

We may also plot the iterated forecasts for both variables by simply
calling \texttt{plot()} on the output of \texttt{predict(VAR\_est)}.

\paragraph{Direct Multiperiod
Forecasts}\label{direct-multiperiod-forecasts}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Direct Multiperiod Forecasts}

A direct multiperiod forecast uses a model where the predictors are
lagged appropriately such that the available observations can be used
\emph{directly} to do the forecast. The idea of direct multiperiod
forecasting is summarized in Key Concept 16.3.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Direct Multiperiod Forecasts]{16.3}
A \textit{direct multiperiod forecast} that forecasts $h$ periods into the future using a model of $Y_t$ and an additional predictor $X_t$ with $p$ lags is done by first estimating
\begin{align*}
  Y_t =& \, \delta_0 + \delta_1 Y_{t-h} + \dots + \delta_{p} Y_{t-p-h+1} + \delta_{p+1} X_{t-h} \\
  +& \dots + \delta_{2p} Y_{t-p-h+1} + u_t,  
\end{align*}

which is then used to compute the forecast of $Y_{T+h}$ based on observations through period $T$.
\end{keyconcepts}

For example, to obtain two-quarter-ahead forecasts of GDP growth and the
term spread we first estimate the equations

\begin{align*}
 GDPGR_t =& \, \beta_{10} + \beta_{11} GDPGR_{t-2} + \beta_{12} GDPGR_{t-3} + \gamma_{11} TSpread_{t-2} + \gamma_{12} TSpread_{t-3} + u_{1t}, \\
 TSpread_t =& \, \beta_{20} + \beta_{21} GDPGR_{t-2} + \beta_{22} GDPGR_{t-3} + \gamma_{21} TSpread_{t-2} + \gamma_{22} TSpread_{t-3} + u_{2t}
\end{align*}

and then substitute the values of \(GDPGR_{2012:Q4}\),
\(GDPGR_{2012:Q3}\), \(TSpread_{2012:Q4}\) and \(TSpread_{2012:Q3}\)
into both equations. This is easily done manually.

Applied economists often use the iterated method since this forecasts
are more reliable in terms of \(MSFE\), provided that the
one-period-ahead model is correctly specified. If this is not the case,
for example because one equation in a VAR is believed to be
misspecified, it can be beneficial to use direct forecasts since the
iterated method will then be biased and thus have a higher \(MSFE\) than
the direct method. See Chapter \ref{ooiatdfglsurt} for a more detailed
discussion on advantages and disadvantages of both methods.

\section{Orders of Integration and the DF-GLS Unit Root
Test}\label{ooiatdfglsurt}

Some economic time series have smoother trends than variables that can
be described by random walk models. A way to model these time series is
\[\Delta Y_t = \beta_0 + \Delta Y_{t-1} + u_t,\] where \(u_t\) is a
serially uncorrelated error term. This model states that the first
difference of a series is a random walk. Consequently, the series of
second differences of \(Y_t\) is stationary. Key Concept 16.4 summarizes
the notation.

\begin{keyconcepts}[Orders of Integration, Differencing and Stationarity]{16.4}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a time series $Y_t$ has a unit autoregressive root, $Y_t$ is integrated of order one. This is often denoted by $Y_t \sim I(1)$. We simply say that $Y_t$ is $I(1)$. If $Y_t$ is $I(1)$, its first difference $\Delta Y_t$ is stationary.
\item $Y_t$ is $I(2)$ when $Y_t$ needs to be differenced two times in order to obtain a stationary series. Using the notation introduced here, $Y_t$ is $I(2)$, its first difference $\Delta Y_t$ is $I(1)$ and its second difference $\Delta^2 Y_t$ is stationary. $Y_t$ is $I(d)$ when $Y_t$ must be differenced $d$ times to obtain a stationary series.
\item When $Y_t$ is stationary, it is integrated of order $0$ so $Y_t$ is $I(0)$.
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.5cm}
It is fairly easy to obtain differences of time series in \texttt{R}. For example, the function \texttt{diff()} returns suitably lagged and iterated differences of numeric vectors, matrices and time series objects of the class \texttt{ts}.

We see that the logarithm of the price level has a smoothly varying
trend. This is typical for an \(I(2)\) series. If the price level is
indeed \(I(2)\), the first differences of this series should be
\(I(1)\). Since we are considering the logarithm of the price level, we
obtain growth rates by taking first differences. Therefore, the
differenced price level series is the series of quarterly inflation
rates. This is quickly done in \texttt{R} using the function
\texttt{Delt()} from the package \texttt{quantmod}. As explained in
Chapter \ref{tsdasc}, multiplying the quarterly inflation rates by
\(400\) yields the quarterly rate of inflation, measured in percentage
points at an annual rate.

\paragraph{The DF-GLS Test for a Unit
Root}\label{the-df-gls-test-for-a-unit-root}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{The DF-GLS Test for a Unit Root}

The DF-GLS test for a unit root has been developed by
\citet{elliott1996} and has higher power than the ADF test when the
autoregressive root is large but less than one. That is, the DF-GLS has
a higher probability of rejecting the false null hypothesis of a
stochastic trend when the sample data stems from time series that is
close to being integrated.

The idea of the DF-GLS test is to test for an autoregressive unit root
in the detrended series, whereby GLS estimates of the deterministic
components are used to obtain the detrended version of the original
series. See Chapter 16.3 of the book for a more detailed explanation of
the approach.

A function that performs the DF-GLS test is implemented in the package
\texttt{urca} (this package is a dependency of the package \texttt{vars}
so it should be already loaded if \texttt{vars} is attached). The
function that computes the test statistic is \texttt{ur.ers}.

Inspecting the summary of the test we find that the test statistic is
about -1.2 which is larger than the \(10\%\) critical value of \(-2.57\)
(this is the appropriate critical value for the ADF test when an
intercept and a time trend are included in the Dickey-Fuller regression
and the test is left-sided) so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
U.S. inflation is nonstationary, using the DF-GLS test.

\section{Cointegration}\label{cointegration}

\begin{keyconcepts}[Cointegration]{16.5}
When $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are $I(1)$ and if there is a $\theta$ such that $Y_t - \theta X_t$ is $I(0)$, $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are cointegrated. Put differently, cointegration of $X_t$ and $Y_t$ means that $X_t$ and $Y_t$ have the same or a common stochastic trend and that this trend can be eliminated by taking a specific difference of the series such that the resulting series is stationary.\newline

\texttt{R} functions for cointegration analysis are implemented in the package \texttt{urca}. 
\end{keyconcepts}

As an example, reconsider the the relation between short- and long-term
interest rates by the example of U.S. 3-month treasury bills, U.S.
10-years treasury bonds and the spread in their interest rates which
have been introduced in Chapter \ref{cybtmpi}. The next code chunk shows

\begin{center}\includegraphics{URFITE_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-699-1} \end{center}

The plot suggests that long-term and short-term interest rates are
cointegrated: notice that both interest series seem to have the same
long-run behavior. They share a common stochastic trend. The term
spread, which is obtained by taking the difference between long-term and
short-term interest rates, seems to be stationary. In fact, the
expectations theory of the term structure suggests the cointegrating
coefficient \(\theta\) to be 1. This is consistent with the visual
result.

\subsubsection*{Testing for
Cointegration}\label{testing-for-cointegration}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Testing for Cointegration}

Following Key Concept 16.5, it seems natural to construct a test for
cointegration of two series in the following manner: if two series
\(X_t\) and \(Y_t\) are cointegrated, the series obtained by taking the
difference \(Y_t - \theta X_t\) must be stationary. If the series are
not cointegrated, \(Y_t - \theta X_t\) is nonstationary. This is an
assumption that can be tested using a unit root test. We generally have
to distinguish between two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{\(\theta\) is known.}

  Knowledge of \(\theta\) enables us to compute differences
  \(z_t = Y_t - \theta X_t\) so that Dickey-Fuller and DF-GLS unit root
  tests can be applied to \(z_t\). For these tests, the critical values
  are the critical values of the ADF test.
\item
  \textbf{\(\theta\) is unknown.}

  If \(\theta\) is unknown, it must be estimated before the unit root
  test can be applied. This is done by estimating the regression
  \[Y_t = \alpha + \theta X_t + z_t\] using OLS (this is refered to as
  the first-stage regression). Then, a Dickey-Fuller test is used for
  testing the hypothesis that \(z_t\) is a nonstationary series. This is
  known as the Engle-Granger Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for
  cointegration (or \emph{EG-ADF test}) after \citet{engle1987}. The
  critical values for this test are special as the associated null
  distribution is nonnormal and depends on the number of \(I(1)\)
  variables used as regressors in the first stage regression. You may
  look them up in Table 16.2 of the book. When there are only two
  presumably cointegrated variables (and thus a single \(I(1)\) variable
  is used in the first stage OLS regression) the critical values for the
  levels \(10\%\), \(5\%\) and \(1\%\) are \(-3.12\), \(-3.41\) and
  \(-3.96\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Application to Interest
Rates}\label{application-to-interest-rates}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Application to Interest Rates}

As has been mentioned above, the theory of the term structure suggests
that long-term and short-term interest rates are cointegrated with a
cointegration coefficient of \(\theta = 1\). In the previous section we
have seen that there is visual evidence for this conjecture since the
spread of 10-year and 3-month interest rates looks stationary.

We continue by using formal tests (the ADF and the DF-GLS test) to see
whether the individual interest rate series are integrated and if their
difference is stationary (for now, we assume that \(\theta = 1\) is
known). Both is conveniently done by using the functions
\texttt{ur.df()} for computation of the ADF test and \texttt{ur.ers} for
conducting the DF-GLS test. Following the book we use data from 1962:Q1
to 2012:Q4 and employ models that include a drift term. We set the
maximum lag order to \(5\) and use the \(AIC\) for selection of the
optimal lag length. Remember that the Dickey-Fuller critical values from
table \ref{tab:DFcrits} are appropriate for both the ADF and the DF-GLS
test.

The corresponding \(10\%\) critical value for both tests is \(-2.57\) so
we cannot reject the null hypotheses of nonstationary for either series,
even at the \(10\%\) level of significance.\footnote{Note:
  \texttt{ur.df()} reports two test statistics when there is a drift in
  the ADF regression. The first of which (the one we are interested in
  here) is the \(t\)-statistic for the test that the coefficient on the
  first lag of the series is 0. The second one is the \(t\)-statistic
  for the hypothesis test that the drift term equals \(0\).} We conclude
that it is plausible to model both interest rate series as \(I(1)\).

Next, we apply the ADF and the DF-GLS test to test for nonstationarity
of the term spread series, which means we test for non-cointegration of
long- and short-term interest rates with cointegration coefficient
\(\theta = 1\).

We find that both tests reject the hypothesis of nonstationarity of the
term spread series at the \(1\%\) level of significance, which is strong
evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the term spread is stationary,
implying cointegration of long- and short-term interest rates.

Since theory suggests that \(\theta=1\), there is no need to estimate
\(\theta\) so it is not necessary to use the EG-ADF test which assumes
\(\theta\) to be unknown. However, since it is instructive to do s,o we
follow the book and compute this test statistic. The first-stage OLS
regression is \[TB10YS_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TB3MS_t + z_t.\]

The test statistic is \(-3.19\) which is smaller than the \(10\%\)

rejected at the \(10\%\) level but not at the \(5\%\) level. This
indicates lower power of the EG-ADF test due to the estimation of
\(\theta\): when \(\theta=1\) is the correct value, we expect the power
of the ADF test for a unit root in the residuals series
\(\widehat{z} = TB10YS_t - \widehat{\beta}_0 - TB3MS\) to be higher than
when some estimate \(\widehat{\theta}\) is used.

\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{A Vector Error Correction Model for
\(TB10YS_t\) and \(TB3MS\)}

If two \(I(1)\) time series \(X_t\) and \(Y_t\) are cointegrated, their
differences are stationary and can be modeled in a VAR which is
augmented by the regressor \(Y_{t-1} - \theta X_{t-1}\). This is called
a \emph{vector error correction model} (VECM) and
\(Y_{t} - \theta X_{t}\) is called the \emph{error correction term}.
Lagged values of the error correction term are useful for predicting
\(\Delta X_t\) and/or \(\Delta Y_t\).

A VECM can be used to model the two interest rates considered in the
previous sections. Following the book we specify the VECM to include two
lags of both series as regressors and choose \(\theta = 1\), as theory
suggests (see above).

Thus the two estimated equations of the VECM are

\begin{align*}
 \widehat{\Delta TB3MS}_t =& \, -\underset{(0.11)}{0.06} + \underset{(0.11)}{0.24} \Delta TB3MS_{t-1} -\underset{(0.15)}{0.16} \Delta TB3MS_{t-2} \\ +& \underset{(0.13)}{0.11} \Delta TB10YS_{t-1} -\underset{(0.11)}{0.15} \Delta TB10YS_{t-2} + \underset{(0.05)}{0.03} ECT_{t-1} \\
 \widehat{\Delta TB10YS}_t =& \, \underset{(0.06)}{0.12} -\underset{(0.07)}{0.00} \Delta TB3MS_{t-1} -\underset{(0.04)}{0.07} \Delta TB3MS_{t-2} \\ +& \underset{(0.10)}{0.23} \Delta TB10YS_{t-1} -\underset{(0.07)}{0.07} \Delta TB10YS_{t-2} -\underset{(0.03)}{0.09} ECT_{t-1}.
\end{align*}

The output produced by \texttt{coeftest()} shows that there is little
evidence that lagged values of the differenced interest series are
useful for prediction. This finding is more pronounced for the equation
of the differenced series of the 3-month treasury bill rate, where the
error correction term (the lagged term spread) is not significantly
different from zero at any common level of significance. However, for
the model equation of the differenced 10-years treasury bonds rate we
find that the error correction term is statistically significant at the
\(1\%\) level with an estimate of \(-0.09\). This can be interpreted as
follows: although both interest rates are nonstationary, their
conintegrating relationship allows to predict the \emph{change} in the
10-years treasury bonds rate using the VECM. In particular, the negative
estimate of the coefficient on the error correction term indicates that
there will be a negative change in the next period's 10-years treasury
bonds rate when the 10-years treasury bonds rate is higher than the
3-month treasury bill rate in the current period.

\section{Volatility Clustering and Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity}\label{volatility-clustering-and-autoregressive-conditional-heteroskedasticity}

Financial time series often exhibit a behavior that is known as
\emph{volatility clustering}: the volatility changes over time and its
degree shows a tendency to persist i.e.~there are periods of low
volatility and periods where volatility is high. Econometricians call
this \emph{conditional heteroskedasticity}. Conditional
heteroskedasticity is an interesting property because it can be
exploited for forecasting the variance of future periods. A good
forecast of a series' variance allows to quantify uncertainty (for
example by computing accurate forecast confidence intervals) which is
especially important when it is hard to come up with a good prediction
of future realizations (see Chapter \ref{cybtmpi}).

As an example, we consider daily changes in the Whilshire 5000 stock
index. The data is available for download at the
\href{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WILL5000INDFC}{Federal Reserve
Economic Data Base}. For consistency with the book we download data from
1989-29-12 to 2013-12-31 (choosing this somewhat larger time span is
necessary since later on we will be working with daily changes of the
series).

The following code chunk shows how to format the data accordingly and
how to reproduce Figure 16.3 of the book.

The level of the series of daily percentage changes in the Wilshire
index seems to randomly fluctuate near zero, meaning there is little
amount autocorrelation so that it is difficult to predict future
outcomes using e.g.~an autoregressive model. However, there is visual
evidence that the series exhibits conditional heteroskedasticity since
we observe volatility clustering. For some applications it is useful to
measure and forecast these patterns. This can be done using models which
assume that the volatility can be described by an autoregressive
process.

\subsection*{ARCH and GARCH Models}\label{arch-and-garch-models}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{ARCH and GARCH Models}

Consider \[Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \gamma_1 X_{t-1} + u_t,\] a
simple ADL(\(1\),\(1\)) regression model. The econometrician Robert
\citet{engle1982} proposed to model \(\sigma^2_t\), the variance of the
normally distributed error \(u_t\), by an order \(p\) distributive lag
model,

\begin{align}
 \sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 u_{t-2}^2 + \dots + \alpha_p u_{t-p}^2, \label{eq:archmodel}
\end{align}

which is called the \emph{autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity}
(ARCH) model of order \(p\), or short ARCH(\(p\)).\footnote{Although we
  introduce the ARCH model as a component in an ADL(\(1\),\(1\)) model,
  it can be used for modelling the conditional zero-mean error term of
  any time series model.} The general idea is apparent from the model
structure: positive coefficients \(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_p\)
imply that recent large squared errors lead to a large variance, and
thus large squared errors, in the current period.

The generalized ARCH (GARCH) model, developed by Tim
\citet{bollerslev1986} is an extension of the ARCH model, where
\(\sigma^2_t\) is allowed to depend on its own lags and lags of the
squared error term. The GARCH(\(p\),\(q\)) model is given by

\begin{align}
 \sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \alpha_2 u_{t-2}^2 + \dots + \alpha_p u_{t-p}^2 + \phi_1 \sigma^2_{t-1} + \dots + \phi_p \sigma^2_{t-q}. \label{eq:garchmodel}
\end{align}

The GARCH model is an ADL(\(p\),\(q\)) model and thus can provide more
parsimonious parameterizations than the ARCH model (see the discussion
in Appendix 15.2 of the book).

\subsection*{Application to Stock Price
Volatility}\label{application-to-stock-price-volatility}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Application to Stock Price Volatility}

Maximum likelihood estimates of ARCH and GARCH models are efficient and
have normal distributions in large samples, such that the usual methods
for conducting inference about the unknown parameters can be applied.
The \texttt{R} package \texttt{fGARCh} is a collection of functions for
analyzing and modelling the heteroskedastic behavior in time series
models. In the following application we reproduce the results presented
in Chapter 16.5 of the book by means of the function
\texttt{garchFit()}. This function is somewhat more sophisticated. It
allows for different specifications of the optimization procedure,
different error distributions and much more (use \texttt{?GarchFit} for
a detailed description of the arguments). In particular, the reported
standard errors reported by \texttt{garchFit()} are robust.

The GARCH(\(1\),\(1\)) model of daily changes in the Wilshire 5000 index
we estimate is given by

\begin{align}
  R_t =& \, \beta_0 + u_t \ , \ u_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_t), \\
  \sigma^2_t =& \, \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \phi_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2 + \nu_t, \label{eq:w5000g11}
\end{align}

where \(R_t\) is the percentage change in period \(t\). \(\beta_1\),
\(\alpha_0\), \(\alpha_1\) and \(\phi_1\) are unknown coefficients and
\(u_t\) and \(\nu_t\) are error terms with conditional mean zero. We do
not include any lagged predictors in the equation of \(R_t\) because the
daily changes in the Wilshire 5000 index reflect daily stock returns
which are essentially unpredictable. Note that \(u_t\) is assumed to be
normally distributed and the variance \(\sigma^2_t\) depends on \(t\) as
it follows the GARCH(\(1\),\(1\)) recursion \eqref{eq:w5000g11}.

It is straightforward to estimate this model using \texttt{garchFit()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# estimate GARCH(1,1) model of daily percentage changes}
\NormalTok{GARCH_Wilshire <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{garchFit}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ W5000_PC}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{Value, }\DataTypeTok{trace =}\NormalTok{ F)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We obtain

\begin{align}
  \widehat{R}_t =& \, \underset{(0.010)}{0.068}, \label{eq:w5000g11est1} \\
  \widehat{\sigma}^2_t =& \, \underset{(0.002)}{0.011} + \underset{(0.007)}{0.081} u_{t-1}^2 + \underset{(0.008)}{0.909} \sigma_{t-1}^2, \label{eq:w5000g11est2}
\end{align}

so the coefficients on \(u_{t-1}^2\) and \(\sigma^2_{t-1}\) are
statistically significant at any common level of significance. One can
show that the persistence of movements in \(\sigma^2_t\) is determined
by the sum of both coefficients which is \(0.99\) here. This indicates
that movements in the conditional variance are highly persistent,
implying long-lasting periods of high volatility which is consistent
with the visual evidence for volatility clustering presented above.

The estimated conditional variance \(\widehat{\sigma}^2_t\) can be
computed by plugging the residuals from \eqref{eq:w5000g11est1} into
equation \eqref{eq:w5000g11est2}. This is performed automatically by
\texttt{garchFit()}, so to obtain a vector of the estimated conditional
standard deviations all we have to do is to read out the values from
\texttt{GARCH\_Wilshire} by appending \texttt{\textbackslash{}@sigma.t}.

Using the vector containing the \(\widehat{\sigma}_t\) we plot bands of
\(\pm\) one conditional standard deviation along with deviations of the
series of daily percentage changes in the Wilshire 5000 index from its
mean. The following code chunk reproduces Figure 16.4 of the book.

We see that the bands of the estimated conditional standard deviations
track the observed heteroskedasticity in the series of daily changes of
the Wilshire 5000 index quite well. This is useful for quantifying the
time-varying volatility and the emerging risk for investors holding
stocks summarized by the index. Furthermore, this GARCH model may also
be used to produce forecast intervals whose widths depend on the
volatility of the most recent periods.

\section{Summary}\label{summary-8}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We have discussed how vector autoregressions are conveniently
  estimated and used for forecasting in \texttt{R} by means of functions
  from the \texttt{vars} package.
\item
  The package \texttt{urca} which is a dependency of \texttt{vars}
  supplies advanced methods for unit root and cointegration analysis
  like the DF-GLS and the EG-ADF tests. In an application we have found
  evidence that 3-months and 10-year interest rates have a common
  stochastic trend (that is they are cointegrated) and thus can be
  modeled using a vector error correction model.
\item
  Furthermore, we have introduced the concept of volatility clustering
  and demonstrated how the function \texttt{garchFit()} from the package
  \texttt{fGarch} can be employed to estimate a GARCH(\(1\),\(1\)) model
  of the conditional heteroskedasticity inherent to returns of the
  Wilshire 5000 stock index.
